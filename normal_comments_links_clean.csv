",METHODOLOGY,"The figures profiled here include money from two sources: These contributors were

  either the sponsors of a PAC that gave to the politician, or they were listed as an individual

  donor's employer. Donors who give more than $200 to any

  federal candidate, PAC or party committee must list their occupation and

  employer. Based on that information, the donor is given an economic code. These totals are conservative,

  as not all of the individual contributions have yet

  been classified by the Center.","In cases where two or more people from the same family contributed, the income-earner's

  occupation/employer is assigned to all non-wage earning family members. If, for instance, Henry Jones

  lists his employer as First National Bank, his wife Matilda lists ""Homemaker"" and 12-year old Tammy

  shows up as ""Student,"" the Center would identify all their contributions as being related to the

  ""First National Bank"" since that's the source of the family's income.","Although individual contributions are generally categorized based on the donor's

  occupation/employer, in some cases individuals may be classified instead as ideological donors.

  A contribution to a candidate may be given an ideological code, rather than an economic code, if

  the contributor gives to an ideological political action committee AND the candidate has received

  money from PACs representing that same ideological interest.","

              NOTE: All the numbers on this page are for the 2009 - 2010 House 

              election cycle and based on Federal Election Commission data available 

              electronically on February 04, 2013.

  profile. Here's why:","Summary numbers - specifically ""Total Raised and Spent"" and ""PAC/Individual Split"" - are

  based on summary reports filed by the candidates with the Federal Election Commission. All other numbers in

  these profiles (""Quality of Disclosure,"" ""Geography"" and ""Special Interests"") are derived from detailed FEC

  reports that itemize all contributions of $200 or more.","There is also a time lag in posting the information. While summary numbers are reported almost

  immediately by the FEC -- and listed quickly on OpenSecrets -- processing and analyzing the detailed records

  takes much longer. For that reason, summary numbers are usually higher (and more current) than the numbers based

  on detailed records.","The figures in these profiles are taken from databases uploaded by the FEC to the internet on

  the first day of every month. Those databases are only as current as the FEC has been able to compile by that

  date (see the note above about lag times for data entry).","The Center updates figures for ""Total Raised and Spent"" and for ""PAC/Individual Split"" a few

  days after the first of the month. The remaining figures - based on detailed contribution data - is updated

  by the Center after the 20th of every month. This gives us time to analyze the contributions and categorize

  them by industry and interest group.","

              ",The hidden infrastructure of the 2012 campaign has already been built.,"A handful of so-called Super PACs, enabled to collect unlimited donations by the continued erosion of campaign finance regulations, are expected to rival the official campaign organizations in importance this election. In many cases, these groups are acting essentially as outside arms of the campaigns.","These are America's best-funded political factions, their war chests filled by some of the richest men (and almost all are men) in the country.","More than 80 percent of giving to Super PACs so far has come from just 58 donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics analysis of the latest data, which covers the first half of 2011. The Republican groups have raised $17.6 million and the Democratic groups $7.6 million. Those numbers will balloon, with American Crossroads, the main Republican Super PAC, aiming to raise $240 million.)","The exceptions are two public employee labor unions, whose massive donations match those of some of the largest moguls. The rest are individuals with vast fortunes at their disposal. They constitute two different tribes.","The conservative red tribe is dominated by businessmen who have built or inherited fortunes. They also include Wall Street investors, oil and gas men, construction magnates, and retail executives. Mormons are well represented.",The liberal blue tribe is dominated by men from Hollywood and media entrepreneurs -- often Jewish -- and the leaders of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).,"The Super PACs are not paragons of transparency, but what has been disclosed gives a sense of where the money is coming from and the interests of those giving it. Based on the donors and the origins of these groups, we can already discern what messages the Super PACs will generate in the home stretch of the campaign.","What follows is a pocket guide to the big money tribes of American politics, what they will tell you -- and what they won't.","

AMERICAN CROSSROADS

","Staffed by former officials from the Republican National Committee and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and associated with Karl Rove. Many consider it more important than the RNC itself. Certainly American Crossroads and Fox News control the GOP's message in a way the Republican National Committee does not and cannot. It is not unfair to say that during a presidential election year, the Republican Party is more an adjunct to American Crossroads, than vice versa.","

The funders:

","Founded by former aides to Mitt Romney, this group is expected to maintain the minimum legal distance between itself and Romney's official campaign. Romney himself even spoke at a Manhattan fundraiser for the group, though -- apparently for legal reasons -- he left the room before an explicit appeal for money was made, the Times reported.","

The funders:

","Also pitching in $1 million to Restore Our Future is Jeremy Blickenstaff, Lund's son-in-law and an attorney who has worked at Nu Skin. He does not have a history of political giving, but Blickenstaff did do a stint at the Marriage Law Foundation, a Utah-based group that ""provides legal resources to defend and protect marriage between a husband and wife.""","What you'll hear: ""We need a man who has run a business running the White House.""","The group is legally barred from coordinating expenditures -- such as buying ads -- with the Romney campaign, but look for it to echo Romney's message closely. Its bare-bones website, for example, declares that ""It is time that we restore our future by supporting candidates who have worked in the private sector and created jobs, who understand the economy, and who believe in America, American workers, and American values."" That candidate is Mitt Romney, the group made clear in its formation announcement in June:","Our nation is burdened by a struggling economy; our job creators who are tied up with red tape, and a growing federal government is stifling the private sector. President Obama has failed to fix the problems that affect Americans. ... Restore Our Future will support our next president, Mitt Romney.","Restore Our Future appears to have kept its powder dry -- so far. As of its most recent Federal Election Commission filings, which cover the first half of 2011, the group has not bought any ad time or spent money on other substantive political action.","What you won't hear: ""Mitt's healthcare plan is superior to Barack's.""","

PRIORITIES USA ACTION

","A Democratic response to Rove's American Crossroads, this group was founded in April by former White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton and former Rahm Emanuel aide Sean Sweeney. It will essentially function as an outside arm of the Obama reelection campaign.","

The funders:

","What you'll hear: ""The GOP will cut your Medicare to fund tax cuts for the rich.""","It has already run a few ads, including a spot blaming Republicans for opposing economic reforms, giving tax breaks to the wealthy, and favoring a plan to ""essentially end Medicare."" Previewing the themes of Obama's reelection campaign if Mitt Romney is the nominee, the group bought ads in South Carolina -- timed for a visit by Romney -- attacking Romney's support of Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare.","What you won't hear: ""Maintain status quo for Wall Street."" ""Forever war in Afghanistan."" ""Yes, we can ... lead from behind.""","

MAJORITY PAC

","Founded this year by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Majority PAC is devoted to helping Democrats win in contested Senate races. ""The best Senate strategists in the country are coming together for 2012 to make sure Senate races have every tool needed to win,"" Susan McCue, one of the leaders of the effort and a former Reid chief of staff, told Politico. ""We are approaching this as a team led by those who know how to win in the toughest, most competitive races across the country."" Reid himself along with Sen. John Kerry have sent out fundraising solicitations for the group, with Reid's pitch explicitly framing Majority PAC as a means to counter ""the deep pockets and nasty tactics of Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers and their network of corporate-backed special interest groups.""","

The funders:

","What you'll hear: ""Tea Party bullies want to cut your Medicare and Obamacare to pay for tax cuts for Wall Street.""","Noting that 23 Senate Democrats are up for reelection in 2012 -- compared to just 10 Republicans -- Majority PAC says it will run ""a transparent, low-overhead, take-no-prisoners Independent Expenditure campaign, [to] aggressively contest critical open seats, exploit opportunities to take over Republican seats and expand our firewall, and respond to attacks from Rove and his allies on Democratic Senate candidates."" So far the group's website features state-specific ads from an affiliate group seizing on the GOP plan to end Medicare.","What you won't hear: ""America yearns for Harry Reid's Las Vegas gravitas.""","

HOUSE MAJORITY PAC

","Yet another liberal Super PAC with deep ties to Democratic officialdom, it was founded this past spring by Ali Lapp, the former campaign director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, along with a couple of other former DCCC officials. The goal: win a Democratic majority in the House.","

WELL-CAPITALIZED: Romney has long been a skilled and prolific campaign fundraiser. He had an $18 million haul between April and June of this year, easily the largest of any current Republican candidate. Convincing donors is seen as just as important as convincing voters, and a big war chest will be a must for the GOP nominee who faces incumbent Obama in November 2012.

",Prosecutors told the trial that the boys had approached the girl when she was playing with a friend. ,"The jury heard that she was taken to a block of flats, a bin shed and a field. ",The girl's mother told the court she had found her daughter with the boys near a field after another child said the pair were hurting her. ,"But barristers for the boys, among the youngest to be prosecuted for rape, said the pair had only been playing a game like doctors and nurses. ","When she was cross-examined earlier in the trial, the eight-year-old told the court she had lied to her mother about what had happened because she had been ""naughty"" and was worried she would not get any sweets. ",Looked exhausted,Mr Justice Saunders previously refused pleas from the boys' barristers to throw out the case after the girl admitted she had not been truthful about some of her evidence. ,"He said that the girl had been consistent in what she told adults, including police and doctors, soon after the incident and said she had looked exhausted at the end of her evidence. ","After the trial, Alison Saunders, chief Crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service London, said the allegations made by the young girl were ""very serious"" and the decision to prosecute ""was not taken lightly"". ","She said: ""She had given a clear and compelling account to the police and her account was consistent with the medical evidence and with the accounts given by other witnesses to the police."" ",,"Det Ch Insp Peter Holdcroft said: ""This was a very complex investigation involving a very young girl but throughout the investigation, her accounts remained consistent. ","""I would like to thank her for her courage in coming forward to the police."" ","NSPCC lawyer Barbara Esam said: ""Research has shown that many young witnesses don't understand the questions they are asked under cross-examination so we believe a pre-recorded interview - with the help of an intermediary in appropriate cases- to be a much better option. ","""Sadly, we still have a way to go to make sure courts work in the best way for children - both defendants and witnesses - who will be frightened and need support all the way through the judicial process if they are going to give their best evidence."" ",The judge invited those involved in the case to make observations about how it had been conducted. ,"""That is not to indicate that there is anything wrong, but we should do everything we can to improve how we deal with these things by looking at the lessons that we can learn,"" he explained.

","** (Disclaimer: Video posted strictly for educational and information purposes only) **A former assistant chief with the Evansville Police Department (EPD) has been suspended for five-days. The Evansville Police Merit Board approved Sergeant Rob Hahn's five-day suspension. The suspension resulted from Hahn's actions on the job over a month ago. According to EPD, Hahn responded to the Arrowhead Motel after receiving a tip about a man with an out-of-county, felony warrant. The body camera footage shows Hahn violating EPD's use of force policy. EPD says Hahn threw the suspect against the wall, onto the bed, and then hitting him in the groin. He reported hitting the suspect to his supervising lieutenant the day it happened. EPD tells that Hahn did not actually miss work, he missed five days of pay. We are told his suspension is over and that he is on regular duty.Donate to PoliceActivity: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivityLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivityFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","

","In the middle of custody proceedings, CPS (Child Protective Services) upon an anonymous called-in complaint, swoops in and charges me with child neglect and inadequate guardianship. This video was taken during an hour long interrogation of me, microanalysing my every otherwise perfectly normal interactions with my daughter, and somehow trying to spin it to make it look evil and incompetent. These were not helpful suggestions or counseling, but edicts imposed upon threat of, and in fact the eventual, removal of my daughter from my life, which they did 5 days after this video was taken.Their charges consisted of my going to McDonalds with my daughter (5 times in three months), having chicken McNuggets, letting her have sugar-free soda and decaf coffee, weighing her on our bathroom scale, and responding to her alarming symptoms to an unknown medication by trying to look it up on the internet with her.For this, they filed a petition in Family Court and took her away from me, slapped a restraining order on me to stay away from her, and effectively gave her mother custody without a custody trial. It should be noted that none of the things they charged me with constitute neglect, and are in fact normal parenting discretions and care that millions of parents do with their kids every day.The fact that this specious court action against me was effected right in the middle of a custody dispute was no accident, and was timed to affirmatively interfere in that proceeding, so as to prejudice the proceedings against me, and give de facto custody to the mother.It might be noted that this particular charge was eventually overturned, dismissed and sealed on administrative appeal, but only after months of my child being taken away from me during which time I was viewed by all I knew as a suspected child abuser. It might also be noted that it was the second of three cases CPS has, so far, launched against me, all either dismissed or found in my favor. The gender discrimination was palpable in this CPS agency, who believed their goal was to ensure custody to mothers, and that men are incapable of taking care of their children.They accomplish this by misusing their public trust, abusing the powers of the state, and officially pillorying fathers via frivolous charges, but charges that would nonetheless each time result in a restraining order keeping me away from my child, and lasting for months or years while they accomplished their real agenda in assisting mothers to win custody.(It is evidenced even here, by their total dismissal and unconcern of several things the mother did, that easily raise to the level of neglect - abandoning our child and leaving her locked out of the apt., not informing me of serious psychiatric medications she is on while I had her on visits, and a month later again losing our kid in a department store. These were of no concern to CPS, but our McDonalds visits or soda drinking was. Their gender prejudice is so embedded, they don't even see it.)If any here wish to view the whole story to date, please visit:http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/...http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-righ...[Also see AVFM News RadioSep 10, 2013 archived podcast of that program can be found at:http://www.blogtalkradio.com/avoicefo...

","March 14, 2014:  Bill (I'm no longer calling him a father) has lost the primary election in Aransas County and will hopefully never be a judge again. Any sympathy or Stockholm Syndrome I ever had for that monster is gone. Please ignore anything nice I ever said about him. He tortured me and my mother for decades on end and I'm glad he's out of the picture. He forced my mother to discipline me the way HE wanted, which is what you see in the video. It wasn't her choice, and to blame her for ANYTHING is to side with the abuser. Learn about the abuser's systems of control here: https://www.psychopathfree.comLearn about the effects of violence on children here: http://www.stopspanking.org/January 10, 2012:  Please, someone help me.  He thinks he's a hero, he thinks he has done nothing wrong and he is some kind of martyr.  He is actively lying to and trying to bribe my little sister.  He told me he ""wasn't mad"" to elicit kindness and then blocked my phone number.  He promised me my school savings in return for the car and he still has every penny AND the car.  He threw away every single chance I gave him at redemption.  This shit is still happening and this man is still in office, denying any wrongdoing and shifting blame in any outward direction he can.  Please god someone help us.2004:  Aransas County Court-At-Law Judge William Adams took a belt to his own teenage daughter as punishment for using the internet to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time.  She has had ataxic cerebral palsy from birth that led her to a passion for technology, which was strictly forbidden by her father's backwards views.  The judge's wife was emotionally abused herself and was severely manipulated into assisting the beating and should not be blamed for any content in this video.  The judge's wife has since left the marriage due to the abuse, which continues to this day, and has sincerely apologized and repented for her part and for allowing such a thing, long before this video was even revealed to exist.  Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgement as a parent himself.  Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again.  His ""judgement"" is a giant farce.  Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter.","

","Here's Reason.tv Producer Jim Epstein's account of what happened: On June 22, 2011, I attended a meeting of the D.C. Taxi Commission for a story I'm currently working on about a proposed medallion system in the district.About half-an-hour into the meeting, I witnessed journalist Pete Tucker snap a still photo of the proceedings on his camera phone. A few minutes later, two police officers arrested Tucker. I filmed Tucker's arrest and the audience's subsequent outrage using my iphone.A few minutes later, as I was attempting to leave the building, I overheard the female officer who had arrested Tucker promise a woman, who I presumed to be an employee of the Taxi Commission, that she would confiscate my phone. Reason intern Kyle Blaine, overheard her say, ""Do you want his phone? I can get his phone.""(The woman who was given assurances by the officer that she could havemy phone can be seen at the end of the video telling me, ""You do nothave permission to record this!"")As I tried to leave, I was told by the same blond female officer to ""stay put."" I told her I was leaving and attempted to exit the building. I was then surrounded by officers, and told to remain still or I would be arrested.I didn't move, but I tried to get the attention of a group of cab drivers who were standing nearby. At this point I was arrested.I spent the remainder of the day in a cell in the basement of the building. I was released at about 4PM.Go to Reason.com for more reporting on this issue, and to http://Reason.tv for downloadable versions of this video.Subscribe to Reason.tv's YouTube Channel to receive notifications as new material goes live.","

"Scott Shackford|Sep. 27, 2017 1:25 pm",Salt Lake City PoliceThe head of the Salt Lake Police Association has watched the country's outrage over the videos showing a nurse getting arrested for refusing to draw a man's blood without a warrant and has decided the correct response is to complain that the public got to see what its officers did.,"Union head Stephen Hartney sent a letter to the city's mayor and police chief to complain video of the brief arrest of nurse Alex Wubbels has made ""pariahs"" of Det. Jeff Payne and his watch commander at the time of the incident, Lt. James Tracy.","Wubbels became an insta-celebrity on Labor Day weekend after she released police body camera footage showing Payne very forcefully arresting her at University of Utah Hospital because she refused his demand that she draw blood from an unconscious victim of a nasty high-speed car crash. The patient, William Gray, was not a suspect, nor involved in the chase, and Payne didn't have a warrant. Wubbels, surrounded by staff at the hospital, explained that she was not permitted to draw the man's blood. Payne arrested her, in what appeared on video to be sheer frustration at having been defied.",Payne and Tracy have been placed on leave while the case was investigated. A couple of weeks ago the city revealed an internal investigation and a civilian review board determined the two officers violated department policies.,Hartney this week complained the police body camera footage should not have been publicly released until the investigation was completed. From the Salt Lake Tribune:,"The letter said the union was, at this point, not arguing or even discussing the merits of the allegations raised against the officers. ""Rather we are solely concerned... with the 'investigatory process' which we believe has been corrupted.""","The letter claims the city has not followed an ""agreed upon and carefully scripted process"" for investigating the conduct of police officers. At the news conference, Hartney focused on if the city should have released the footage so soon under the state's Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA), considering the release could have interfered with the internal affairs investigation.","The release of the body cam footage and information from the disciplinary investigation ""has created a public furor which makes reasoned determinations difficult, if not impossible,"" the letter states.","The city, however, didn't release the videos. It agreed to a request by Wubbels to release the footage to her, following the law Hartney referenced. The city said it had no good reason to deny the video footage to Wubbels.",The two officers weren't even put on administrative leave until after Wubbels went public with the video footage.,What might have been forgotten in all of this is Wubbels released the video because she believed she was exposing a widespread problem of police bullying nurses into drawing blood without consent or a warrant.,"And while Wubbels was pleased the Salt Lake City Police had been responsive to her claims of abuse, she and other hospital staff were concerned about other law enforcement agencies, including university police. Campus police did absolutely nothing during the arrest, and since then the hospital has implemented new policies to limit police access to parts of the hospital.","Public pressure and response is important to holding police officers accountable. They are public servants, and Hartney's responses, like we've seen from other police union leaders, misuse the concept of due process to try to conceal information from the people to whom the police are supposed to answer.",Yesterday we saw that a North Carolina law exempting body camera footage from public records requests was very clearly being used to try to shield police from exposure of conduct that might expose them to public criticism.,"Gray, the car crash victim unable to consent to Payne's demand for a blood draw, died Monday while still in the hospital.",Photo Credit: Salt Lake City Police,Scott Shackford is an associate editor at Reason.com,Scott Shackford is an associate editor at Reason.com,"

With rifles pointing toward each side and tensions reaching a critical level, federal land officials backed off and agreed to give up the cattle to Bundy's family and supporters.

The mid-afternoon release by the Bureau of Land Management was hailed as a victory among supporters who had forced the closure of Interstate 15 after marching to the holding pen on the sides of the highway, although environmentalists condemned the agency's decision.

The BLM, upset that Bundy has refused to pay about $1 million in grazing fees to the federal government for two decades, had seized at least one-third of his cattle earlier this past week in a raging debate that captured national attention and whose purpose also was to protect a critical habitat of the threatened desert tortoise.

But on Saturday the BLM decided to halt the roundup, fearing for the safety of its agents and the public.

Much of BLM's anger is founded on some long-time injustices but the second they foment riots and react like psychos and just target white people as racist, they lose 100% of their credibility.

Then the police acquired a helicopter. Now, when a noise complaint is called in, the helicopter's dispatched to circle over the neighborhood, beaming its spotlight down onto the house and its surroundings, while the loudspeaker booms out orders for everyone to go home, in the process awakening everyone within a quarter-mile of the house.

Cleveland Weather Summary: 52 degrees,1 Closing Alert,"A Euclid police officer who allegedly pulled out his gun during an off-duty bar fight back in August has been fired, with the mayor saying she ""no longer [has] confidence that you can perform successfully as a member of the Euclid Police Department.""","On Aug. 24, 32-year-old Officer Todd Gauntner and two members of the ""Hells Angels"" organization were involved in an altercation on the patio of Frank and Tony's Place on Second Street in Willoughby. Gauntner was apparently one of the aggressors, and investigators say he brandished his weapon and pointed it at the two men before a physical fight occurred that had to be broken up by bar patrons.","Gauntner was arrested and charged with using a weapon while intoxicated, and his case remains open in Willoughby Municipal Court. He was also suspended from his job for 15 days with pay while the department's internal affairs division investigated the incident.","According to a letter sent to Gauntner by Mayor Kristen Holzheimer Gail, Police Chief Scott Meyer recommended to her back on Sept. 11 that Gauntner be terminated from the force. A hearing was held two days later to consider all explanations regarding the altercation, but in the end it was agreed that Gauntner should be let go.","Mayor Gail, in the letter, chastised Gauntner for inviting trouble by making ""disparaging comments"" to the bikers and for not removing himself from the situation, adding he nearly lost his gun in the disturbance and ""put yourself and many bar patrols at a significant risk of substantial harm due to your reckless behavior.","""Your actions have brought discredit to you as a member of the Euclid Police Department,"" she wrote.",Gauntner's termination took effect Sept. 17.

Filed Under:

 immunity, middle finger, police, traffic stop

",Permalink.Short link.,"Expressing your displeasure with law enforcement via hand gestures is not an arrestable offense. It can't even justify a traffic stop. Officers are learning this, one federal case at a time.

","Tim Geigner covered a case five years ago involving a cop, a veteran, and the veteran's upraised middle finger. It was expressive conduct the cop manning the speed trap found worthy of a traffic stop. A federal court disagreed, finding the officer's stated reason for conducting a traffic stop laughable.

","Perhaps there is a police officer somewhere who would interpret an automobile passenger's giving him the finger as a signal of distress, creating a suspicion that something occurring in the automobile warranted investigation. And perhaps that interpretation is what prompted Insogna to act, as he claims. But the nearly universal recognition that this gesture is an insult deprives such an interpretation of reasonableness. This ancient gesture of insult is not the basis for a reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation or impending criminal activity. Surely no passenger planning some wrongful conduct toward another occupant of an automobile would call attention to himself by giving the finger to a police officer.

","Yes, the officer actually claimed the bird is a universal distress signal and initiated the stop only because he believed Swartz was trying to flag down help for his wife, who was driving the vehicle.

","Let the deja vu commence. (via The Newspaper)

","The federal judge finds Coleman's defense of his actions similarly comical. The decision [PDF] contains this incisive footnote:

","So, it's a case exactly on point, even if the court doesn't have to reference the Swartz case to deny Coleman's requested immunity.

","On top of that, there's another case directly on point that can be used to hold Coleman liable for his retaliatory traffic stop.

","From Duran:

","The plaintiff, Brian Clark, maintained he didn't flip off the officer, so that eliminates his First Amendment claim. If Clark did not engage in one-fingered expressive conduct (as he denies doing), there's no First Amendment activity prompting retaliation. However, the Fourth Amendment remains alive, if currently covered by the clumsy, authoritarian footprints of Lt. Coleman, who is now completely stripped of his immunity shield.

","Cops see a lot of animosity from citizens. But it's just part of the job. It may be unpleasant but it's not an arrestable offense, much less reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop. With rare exceptions, courts have sided with citizens and their expressive conduct. And they should continue to do so, because that's what separates the US from the world's authoritarian governments. This is also from the Duran decision, which is quoted directly in this case:

","The freedom of individuals to oppose or challenge police action verbally without thereby risking arrest is one important characteristic by which we distinguish ourselves from a police state. Thus, while police, no less than anyone else, may resent having obscene words or gestures directed at them, they may not exercise the awesome power at their disposal to punish individuals for conduct that is not merely lawful, but protected by the First Amendment.

","If a citizen lets the bird fly, officers should either let it ride or immediately seek legal representation. The courts say expressions of displeasure towards our government are the reason the First Amendment exists. Any cop who thinks an obscene gesture justifies a traffic stop is in the wrong business. Or the wrong country.

"Jacob Sullum  | February 27, 2013","Imagine that a police officer, after taking it upon himself to

search someone's car, is asked to explain why he thought he would

find contraband there. ""A little birdie told me,"" he

claim. But substitute ""a big dog"" for ""a little birdie,"" and you've



ruled that ""a court can presume"" a search is valid if police

say it was based on an alert by a dog trained to detect drugs. The

Court thereby encouraged judges to accept self-interested

proclamations about a canine's capabilities, reinforcing the

alarmingly common use of dogs to justify invasions of

with 

false-positive error rates as high as 96 percent in the field.

A 2006 

Australian study found that the rate of unverified alerts by 17

police dogs used to sniff out drugs on people ranged from 44

no drugs are found ""the dog may not have made a mistake at all,"" as

Justice Elena Kagan put it, 

writing for the Court. Instead it ""may have detected substances

that were too well hidden or present in quantities too small for

Furthermore, probable cause is supposed to hinge on whether there

is a ""fair probability"" that a search will discover evidence of a

crime. The possibility that dogs will react to traces of drugs that

are no longer present makes them less reliable for that

odors from legal substances, distractions such as food, or cues

from their handlers. Given all the potential sources of error, it

is hard to assess a dog's reliability without looking at its

real-world track record.","That is why the Florida Supreme Court, in the 

2011 decision that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned, said

police should provide information about a dog's hits and misses.

""The fact that the dog has been trained and certified,"" it said,

""is simply not enough to establish probable cause,"" especially

when, as in most states, there are no uniform standards for

success at finding drugs in the field. She said police testing in

artificial conditions is a better measure of reliability, even

though handlers typically 

know where the drugs are hidden and can therefore direct the

animals to the right locations, either deliberately or

reliable, this decision puts the burden on the defense to show the

dog is not reliable through expert testimony and other

evidence that casts doubt on the training and testing methods used

by police. But experts are expensive, and police control all the

departments simply do not keep track of how often dog alerts lead

to unsuccessful searches, and this decision will only encourage

use drug-sniffing dogs at will during routine traffic stops and

may 

search cars without a warrant, based on their own determination

of probable cause. Now that it has said a dog's alert by itself

suffices for probable cause, a cop with a dog has the practical

power to search the car of anyone who strikes him as

suspicious.","Even the question of whether a dog did in fact alert may be

impossible to resolve if there is no video record of the encounter,

which is often the case. As Florida defense attorney Jeff Weiner



puts it, the justices ""have given law enforcement a green light

to do away with the Fourth Amendment merely by uttering the magic

words, 'My dog alerted.'""",Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine and a nationally syndicated columnist.,Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine and a nationally syndicated columnist.,"

"Zuri Davis|Jul. 11, 2018 4:30 pm","The press wants access to footage that might show what Broward County sheriff's deputies were doing during the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School earlier this year. Broward County officials would rather not give it to them. After a judge ruled in the media's favor, the school board and the state attorney appealed the ruling. Yesterday the Fourth District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach, Florida, heard oral arguments in the case.","The battle began when the sheriff confirmed that the school's resource officer, Scot Peterson, did not go inside of the school to confront the shooter. (Peterson eventually resigned from the department with a $8,702.35-a-month lifetime pension.) Then members of the Coral Springs Police Department claimed to CNN that three more sheriff's deputies remained outside the school and hidden behind their vehicles when they arrived on the scene. It was not clear whether the shooter was in fact still in the building when the officers arrived, but the Coral Springs cops were upset either way that the deputies did not join them inside the school.","Hoping to explain the deputies' behavior, several media organizations sued for the exterior footage. Officials resisted the request, claiming that releasing the footage could facilitate future attacks by revealing blind spots in the school's surveillance system.","Attorney Dana McElroy, representing the plaintiffs, points out that Broward Superintendent Robert Runcie has promised to improve school surveillance. So even if someone somewhere really is plotting a second attack, whatever info he might glean from the video would be outdated.","""The footage is the only objective evidence of what occurred and when,"" Barbara Petersen of the First Amendment Foundation, which has joined the media side of the lawsuit, tells the Miami Herald. ""The whole purpose of our open government laws is oversight and accountability. Access to the video footage allows us to hold those accountable who may not have done their jobs.""","Though the sheriff's office fought the initial lawsuit, it did not join the school board and the state attorney in the appeal. Spokesperson Veda Coleman-Wright has said the office has no objection to publicizing the footage.",Photo Credit: Daniel Varela/TNS/Newscom,Zuri Davis is assistant editor at Reason.,Zuri Davis is assistant editor at Reason.,"

"," West Valley, Utah police have said they thought  Danielle Willard was buying drugs when they killed her in an apartment complex, the Salt Lake City Tribune has reported. "," She tried to back her car into them when they approached her, police say. "," The suit claims she was ""shot in the back of the head, assassination style"" and that it was ""without justification"" and ""unrelated to any legitimate law enforcement purpose."" "," The death of Willard set off a public firestorm over the West Valley, Utah's narcotics department. The FBI began investigating the department, as did the city itself,  The New York Times reported. West Valley officials found that in some cases officers on the narcotics squad mishandled evidence. "," Willard, who struggled with heroin addiction, had gone to Utah for rehab, her mother Melissa Kennedy told The Times. She was unarmed when she died. ", Her mother says part of the reason for filing the lawsuit is to find out exactly what happened to her daughter. ," ""It's the only way that people are going to know what happened to her and why,"" Kennedy told the Tribune.

departments in the greater Chicago area found that vehicle searches

initiated after dogs alerted failed to turn up drugs or drug

paraphernalia 56 percent of the time. Other studies find false

positives as high as 74 percent and 80 percent.","Yet in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that as long as police

say the dog is trained or accurate, ""a court can

presume that the dog's alert provides probable cause to search""

Reason Senior Editor Jacob Sullum, who has written



extensively on the issue, ""that's a very useful tool to have to

search people you have other grounds to think are suspicious.""

Sullum stresses that there are no uniform or reliable certification

standards for training drug-sniffing dogs.","While convinced of dogs' potential usefulness, Falco agrees that

police dogs are generally poorly trained and handled.","Indeed, in the wake of such appalling cases such as Young's in

New Mexico, Falco worries that drug-sniffing dogs will be

completely discredited. ""I've seen cases where people have trained

their own dogs in their backyards and then taken it to work as a

drug dog. I've seen that happen,"" he says. ""We're going to lose

"J.D. Tuccille|Aug. 5, 2014 11:04 am","Barry Township PD Facebook pageBarry Township, Michigan, with

a population of about 4,000, has four full-time

police officers, four part-time officers, two Humvees, two

armored personnel carriers (free, courtesy of the 

three dozen unpaid but armed and empowered reserve police officers

patrolling the streets. All those cops need to find something to do

with themselves, and many of the people of Barry Township are more

than a bit bent out of shape that they've been on the receiving end

of that something.","Writes L.L. Brasier of the 

Detroit Free Press:","Early morning May 10, Jack Nadwornik stepped behind Tujax

Tavern, the bar and restaurant he has owned for 30 years in this

small, western Michigan town.","Nadwornik, out drinking with friends for his 58th birthday,

urinated in a corner of the empty parking lot because the bar was

locked up.","Within seconds, two Barry Township police cars and three

zipping up his pants. What happened next is up for debate: Police

who was leaving work agreed.","What everyone does agree on is the aftermath: Nadwornik had a

broken hand from a police baton, bloody elbows, and he had been

kneed in the back. He was handcuffed, jailed and charged with

disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, a two-year felony.","If this was just a one-off incident, Nadwornik's friends would

be bent out of shape and his lawyer would be prepping a lawsuit.

But this is only one high-profile incident in a sleepy town where

people complain that the cops are out of control, and police chief

Victor Pierce justifies his paramilitary machine on the grounds of

""terrorism, barricaded gunmen and mass shootings.""","Oh, yeah. And God.","""I have preached a vision and the Lord put me here for a

reason,"" he told the township board.","Barry TownshipThe township's insurance company finally forced

the police chief to make his small army of reserve officers stand

down and confine themselves to special events (it also forced the

town of Oakley, population 290, to put its army of 100 reserve

officers on ice).","After a packed town meeting last night that had to be moved to

the high school to accommodate attendees, the township board



unanimously voted to review Pierce's continuing employment in a

special meeting to be held tonight.* A notice of the meeting

occupies the township

Website's entire front page.","So, one small step in rolling back the militarization of

modern policing? Or just the latest bit of evidence that law

enforcement in the United States has gone full-on into occupying

enemy territory mode?",That might depend on the outcome of tonight's the meeting.,"*The meeting is being rescheduled because of what sounds like

"createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath                                            AP                                    Cleveland police officials said Friday they're  disciplining 75 of officers for their involvement in  a police chase that ended in the shooting deaths of an unarmed man and woman, The Plain Dealer reports. "," The pair were shot at 137 times while in their car, parked in a middle school parking lot. No officers were injured in what police called a  ""full blown-out"" firefight. "," Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine told reporters in February that ""there is nothing normal about this case. ... This is a tragedy."" "," In November, about  60 police vehicles pursued the two suspects  in a 25-minute chase spanning three cities. One suspect, 30-year-old Malissa Williams, was shot 24 times, and the other, 43-year-old Timothy Russell, was shot 23 times. "," At the time,  police said the suspects fired shots at them near Cleveland's downtown Justice Center, according to The Plain Dealer. And a police dispatcher said that shots were fired at officers during the chase. "," But after the chase ended in a gunfight near Heritage Middle School, police checked the car and realized neither Williams nor Russell was armed. ", It isn't clear whether a shot was actually fired at the officer who initiated the chase. Some speculate the Malibu driven by Russell may have backfired. , A report from the state's attorney general shows the officers likely believe the suspects were armed based on erroneous information broadcast over the police radio. Officers told investigators they saw the suspects in the car with what looked like a gun. ," Russell might have fled from police initially, fueling the massive chase,  because he was high and driving on a suspended license. Toxicology results show that Russell was  under the influence of cocaine and alcohol at the time of his death. Williams was also high on cocaine and had marijuana in her system. "," The officers being disciplined for violating police protocol won't lose their jobs and did not partake in the gunfight at the end of the chase, but they did have a role in the pursuit. More than 100 police officers were involved in the chase in some way. "," Nineteen of the 75 officers facing discipline for offenses ranging from engaging in a chase without permission to providing false information on police reports will have disciplinary hearings and might be suspended temporarily, according to The Plain Dealer. "," In 2011, the newspaper  published an investigation of reports of excessive use of nondeadly force by Cleveland police officers. The newspaper found that the police chief often overlooked inconsistencies with police officers' stories when investigating use of force incidents.                                                                                                     ", Many of the officers faced accusations of brutality on the force. ,,

"Joe Setyon|Sep. 5, 2018 2:50 pm","Martin Brayley/Dreamstime.comA Cincinnati cop failed to follow department policy when he tased an 11-year-old girl for shoplifting last month, police investigators say.","As Reason reported last month, Brown was off-duty and working security at a Kroger on August 6 when he investigated three girls believed to be shoplifting. According to a police use of force review, he told one of the girls, 11-year-old Donesha Gowdy, to stop and show her receipt, but she wouldn't listen. Gowdy exited the store, at which point Brown tased her from roughly 10 feet away.","The tasing itself wasn't caught on Brown's body camera, but he turned it on soon after. Then he took Gowdy into the Kroger manager's office. ""Sweetheart, the last thing I want to do is tase you like that. When I say stop, you stop. You know you're caught. Just stop. That hurt my heart to do that to you,"" Brown can be heard telling Gowdy. ""You broke the law, and you fled as I tried to apprehend you.""","He adds: ""You know what, Sweetheart, this is why there aren't any grocery stores in the black community."" Brown and Gowdy are both black.",,Additional body camera footage shows Gowdy crying as firefighters remove the taser barbs from her body.,"Gowdy was eventually taken into custody on charges of theft and obstruction of official business. According to the use of force review, she was accused of stealing $53.81 worth of merchandise, including a backpack, clothing, and drinks. The charges have since been dropped.",But Brown is in hot water. The Cincinnati Enquirer summed up the four department policies he's accused of breaking:,The [grocery stores] comment constituted prejudice.,He did not turn on his body camera until after he deployed his Taser.,"He did not warn the girl he was going to use his Taser. He told her to stop three times as she was exiting the store, but did not warn that he was going to escalate his use of force.",The incident wasn't serious enough to deploy a Taser. Police investigators said officers should use the least amount of force necessary when dealing with juveniles.,"The Cincinnati Police Department's use of force policies aren't great to begin with. As the Enquirer notes, officers are allowed to tase suspects as young as 7 and as old as 70. But Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac has defended the use of force policies. ""There may be some areas in which we can tweak,"" he told the Cincinnati City Council's Law and Public Safety Committee yesterday, ""but I believe we do have a very solid policy around our use of force.""","This isn't the first time Brown has gotten in trouble with the department. Last year he was written up for using a homophobic slur to describe an alleged domestic violence victim. It's not clear what his punishment will be this time around. That's up to Isaac, who will make a decision after Brown gets an internal hearing.",Photo Credit: Martin Brayley/Dreamstime.com,Joe Setyon is an assistant editor at Reason.,Joe Setyon is an assistant editor at Reason.,"

If she was not, then the officer has clearly committed a tort against her.","Second, I wonder what instruction, if any, Kroger management gave the officer when he was hired. The officer was acting as their agent, rather than that of the police department, and the issue should be viewed from that context. If the management called for a limit on the use of force that would not permit the tasering, then the officer stands alone in responsibility; otherwise Kroger management shares that responsibility.","Third, I wonder if the officer's primary employment with the police is providing a level of immunity for him. If it does, this is the crux of the problem with the scenario. By providing that immunity, the police force could have easily led the officer to act with less restraint that he would have if he knew that he would be held fully accountable for his actions. I suspect this is the case, and the author could have highlighted this issue better.",log in or register to reply,Vernon Depner|9.6.18 @ 3:49PM|#,"Yes, the girl was guilty of theft. She was seen putting items into the backpack, which itself was stolen.

system treats all racial groups equally, compared to 17% of African

Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans. White Republicans stand

out with a solid majority (65%) who say the justice system treats

everyone the same; however, only about a third of non-white

Republicans agree. Seven in 10 white and non-white Democrats alike

believe the system is biased in favor of whites.","White Americans are more likely to believe accounts of racial

bias in the system if they are predisposed toward empathy.

Respondents who score high on the Sensitivity to Harm Index (SHI)

are more than twice as likely to believe racial bias plagues the

criminal justice system than those who score low (62% vs.

28%).6","Most

Americans agree about top priorities for the police","Although Americans have different perceptions about how the

police actually do their jobs, majorities of black, white,

and Hispanic Americans agree on what the top three priorities for

the police should be: investigating violent crime (78%), protecting

citizens from crime (64%), and investigating property crime

(58%).","Majorities across racial and ethnic groups agree on path

toward reform","Majorities across racial and ethnic groups also oppose a

variety of actual and alleged police practices:","Six in 10 Americans (59%) support police using drones,

privacy","Americans across demographic and political groups support police

use of drones. However, Democrats and independents (57%) are more

wary than Republicans (46%) about the risks drones present to

privacy.","Americans want police to get warrants before conducting

searches of cars and houses and before monitoring phone

calls","Americans agree that even if a person is suspected of breaking

the law, police should obtain a court order before searching

regularly checking cars for drugs during routine traffic stops

without a court order.","However, Americans might be willing to bend the rules depending

on the suspect. While 66% say police ought to obtain a court order

before searching the home of a suspected drug dealer, only 51% feel

need a court order to search the home of a person the police think

Toward Police","Many

American conservatives have a greater respect for authority that

may predispose them to hold more positive views of the police.

Americans who score high on our Respect for Authority Index (RAI)

(who also happen to be disproportionately conservative) are much

more likely than those who score low to favor pedestrian stops (87%

vs. 43%), to favor police using drones (71% vs. 46%), to say police

only use lethal force when necessary (69% vs. 41%), and to say

there is a war on police (77% vs. 42%).8 Statistical

tests indicate that being conservative predicts attitudes toward

the police much more than being liberal.","Changes in socioeconomic status or partisanship do

enforcement","White

Republicans and whites with higher incomes report more favorable

attitudes toward the police than white Democrats and whites with

lower incomes. However, blacks who are Republican or have higher

incomes are not much more likely to report favorable attitudes

toward the police than blacks who are Democratic or have lower

incomes. 9 Thus, race appears to affect views of

the police even after considering the influence of income and

ideology.","These data provide some indication that if whites become

wealthier and more Republican they become more favorable toward the

police; however, African Americans do not become more favorable

toward the police if their income rises or they become more

imprison 20,000 innocent people, while 40% say it would be worse to

have 20,000 guilty people who are free.","Majorities of Republicans (55%), independents (60%), and

America","At first glance, most Americans (64%) have favorable attitudes

toward their local police department and are confident their local

police use the appropriate amount of force (58%), are courteous

(57%) and honest (57%), treat all racial groups equally (56%),

protect people from violent crime (56%), respond quickly to a call

for help (56%), and care about community members (55%).","Furthermore, 65% of Americans worry that police officers have

view intensifying criticism of policing practices as an attack on

today.","Attitudes toward the police vary across four ideological

groups of Americans: Libertarians, Liberals, Conservatives, and

Communitarians","To improve upon ideological self-identification (i.e.

liberal/conservative) this report uses answers to a three-question

screen (found in Appendix A) about the role of government in

economic and personal affairs to identify four primary groups of

Americans: Liberals (18%) who favor a larger government that

Communitarians (16%) who favor a larger government that promotes

traditional values, and Conservatives (26%) who favor a smaller

government that promotes traditional values. (Another 25% do not

fit in any of these categories). This report also examines how

these four ideological clusters perceive policing in America

today.","At

first glance Americans seem generally satisfied with their local

law enforcement. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Americans have a

favorable view of the police in their communities, including 33%

view. Only 14% say they have an unfavorable view of their local

police, and another 22% say they have neither positive nor negative

feelings. (See Appendix B for citizen evaluations of police.)","These topline numbers, however, conceal stark differences in

attitudes toward the police across race/ethnicity, age, education,

income, and ideology. While some groups have firmly positive views

of the police, others believe policing suffers from systematic

problems.","Although 64% of Americans overall have a favorable opinion of

their local police, only 40% of black Americans and 59% of Hispanic

Americans agree. In contrast, white Americans have a much more

favorable (68%) perception of the police in their communities. This

the police particularly merits additional investigation.","Millennials

(Americans under 35) (53%), lower income households (<$30,000),

and high school graduates (59%) are also about 20 points less

favorable toward the police than Americans over 65 (82%), middle

and higher income households ($50,000+) (76%), and high school

graduates (73%).11 Suburban residents are only slightly

more favorable toward the police (69%) than urban residents (60%).

Notably, men and women have similar views of the police. (See

Appendix C for breakdown of attitudes by demographics.)","Partisanship significantly correlates with attitudes toward the

police. Republicans are more than 20 points more favorable toward

the police (81%) than Democrats (59%) and independents (59%).

Similarly, ideological Conservatives stand out as the group most

Appendix A for definitions of ideological clusters.)","Although some groups have less favorable attitudes toward the

police, additional findings in the survey suggest these groups are

views of the police. Only, 12% of Hispanics, 13% of whites, and 19%

Americans (40%) and Hispanics (28%) are more likely than whites

(18%) to feel conflicted and report neutral rather than positive or

priorities ought to be: investigating violent and property crime

should lead a person to want fewer police in a community.  But no group

wishes to decrease the number of police officers in their

communities (about 9 in 10 oppose). Instead, about half of blacks,

whites, and Hispanics favor maintaining present levels and more

than a third say their community needs more officers.","These confidence gaps come with consequences. Effective policing

depends on police and their communities working together in a

symbiotic relationship based on mutual respect and trust. The

police are best able to serve and protect their communities when

the residents freely cooperate with the police, for instance when

residents are willing to report a crime they witness.","However, individuals who have less favorable opinions of the

police are less likely to report a crime. For instance, while 78%

crime they witnessed, considerably fewer African Americans (54%)

and Hispanics (57%) feel as confident. Fewer than half of African

American men with annual incomes less than $30,000 a year would

violent crime if they saw one compared to seniors (87% vs. 53%). In

addition, households making less than $30,000 a year (62%) and high

school graduates (68%) are considerably less likely than those

making over $60,000 a year (79%) or college graduates (81%) to be

confident they would report a violent crime they witnessed.","When residents feel the justice system is fair and impartial,

they have confidence in the police. Such confidence encourages

cooperation with the police, which is necessary to reduce

crime.14 Moreover, when the police have

legitimacy, the law has legitimacy, which encourages compliance

with the law. Studies have shown that citizens are more likely to

obey the law when the police have legitimacy.15","In communities that distrust local law enforcement, police

departments should seek to earn the trust and confidence of

officers do their jobs effectively and safely.","In

order to rebuild trust and confidence in law enforcement, we must

first understand what is driving these disparate attitudes toward

police. The use of public opinion surveys can help to uncover not

only what people think about the police but also to understand

whythey think what they do. This can enable police departments and

lawmakers to craft policies to improve police-community

relations.","The Race Gap This report focuses on racial gaps

in views of the police and does so for several reasons.","First, race and ethnicity are associated with sharp differences

in favorability toward the police (see Appendix C). Moreover,

public opinion studies of the police have long found that race

strongly predicts attitudes toward the police.16","Age, income, and education can change, but the race and

ethnicity of individuals persists. Thus, racial gaps in views of

the police are more durable over time.","Surveys

indicate that the racial divide on policing has not changed much

over the past 50 years. In 1970 a national poll found 67% of white

Americans and 43% of African Americans had a favorable view of the

police.17 Similarly today, 68% of whites and

40% of blacks have a favorable view of the police. This suggests

police reforms implemented since the 1970s have done little to

close the confidence gap.","Race appears to affect views of the police even after

considering the effects of other demographic factors. For instance,

whites making more than $60,000 a year (79%) are more than 20

points more likely than whites making less than $30,000 (56%) a

year to have a favorable view of the police. However, higher income

African Americans (48%) are not much more likely than lower income

African Americans (41%) to have positive views of the police.","A similar pattern emerges across partisans. White Republicans

(83%) are nearly 20 points more likely than white Democrats to feel

favorable toward the police. However, black Republicans (44%) are

no more likely than black Democrats (44%) to have a favorable view.



Thus race appears to affect attitudes toward the police even after

considering the influence of income and ideology.19","Despite the fact that Hispanics comprise 17.4% of the US

population, little research has examined the similarities and

differences in attitudes between Hispanics and other

groups.20 The little research that does exist

should not be combined with other groups. 21 Our data also

this endeavor, the survey included oversamples of African Americans

and Hispanics (see Survey Methodology Section). Results are

perceptions, experiences, and beliefs about law enforcement that

may impact overall favorability toward the police. Next it examines

which of these perceptions and experiences best predicts

favorability toward the police. Lastly, the report investigates

public support for a variety of reforms and policy changes proposed

experiences that may impact their general favorability toward the

respect for authority figures, preferences about police priorities,

experiences with the police and perceptions of police competency,

professionalism, impartiality, use of force, accountability and

integrity. It then examines the extent to which each may correlate

with favorability toward the police.","22

Despite falling crime rates nationally, some surveys show Americans

continue to believe crime is getting worse each year. For instance,

Gallup found about two-thirds of Americans say there is more crime

in the United States today that there was a year ago, and that this

share has increased over time. Even at a local level, about half of

year ago. However, although Americans may say crime is higher, this

report shows they are less concerned about being a crime victim

than in the past, which reflects the fact that crime rates are

officers have limited time and resources and thus must decide how

to prioritize their duties. Americans generally agree on the top

three priorities for law enforcement: first, investigating violent

crime like murder, assaults, and domestic violence (78%), second,

protecting individuals from violent crime (64%), and third

investigating property crime and robbery (58%).","A little under a third (30%) think police should make enforcing

drug laws a top three priority.","Notably, only 19% say police should make enforcing traffic laws

a top priority. In other words, Americans de-prioritize the task

leading to the most common interaction individuals have with the

three tasks for law enforcement; however, groups differ in

intensity of support. Perhaps most strikingly, African Americans

(63%) to prioritize the police investigating property crime and

personal police contact in the past five years) 56% of white

Americans report having had a satisfactory police encounter in the

past five years, as do 38% of African Americans and 51% of

differently. Eight in 10 Republicans report being satisfied with

their police encounters over the past five years, compared to six

in 10 Democrats and independents.","Not surprisingly, satisfaction with personal police contact is

more times in the past five years, as do 18% of whites and 13% of

Hispanics. In a similar pattern, 17% of blacks report being stopped

three or more times, compared to 8% of whites and 4% of

Hispanics.","There

is some evidence that black Americans are more likely to be stopped

by police as their income rises than white Americans similarly

they are significantly more likely to report being stopped by

police (see Appendix D).29 However, white and Hispanic

Americans are no more likely to report being stopped by police as

their income rises. For instance, blacks with incomes over $50,000

a year (Mean =1.34 stops) report being stopped at about 1.5 times

the rate of whites with incomes over $50,000 a year (Mean =.91

stops). 30 Among those making less than $50,000

scrutiny. For instance, actor Isaiah Washington tweeted that he

sold his Mercedes and bought three less expensive Honda Priuses

private-equity financier Robert Smith have shared similar stories

of being stopped three to seven times a year.32",Types of Personal Contact,"About

a quarter (27%) of Americans report having had an experience in

which a police officer kept them or their family member safe in a

potentially dangerous situation. Such reports do not vary

considerably among demographic and political groups. As one would

expect, individuals who report being kept safe (76%) are about 16

points more likely to report a favorable opinion of the police than

influence their attitudes toward the police.33 People who

live in densely populated areas are more likely to come into

contact with officers. City centers also are more likely to have

higher crime rates, which may increase the likelihood one has an

encounter with law enforcement.34 However, actual

differences in favorability toward the police by community type are

rather small. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of individuals living in the

suburbs have a favorable view of the police, as do 60% of those

living in cities and 61% residing in rural areas.","In general, nearly 6 in 10 Americans give their local police

forces high marks for enforcing the law (59%), protecting people

from violent crime (56%) and responding quickly to a call for help

(56%). Slightly fewer (50%) give their local police a high rating

for solving crime.35 However, there are significant

differences across race/ethnicity, ideology, income, and urban

density in perceptions of police competency (see Appendix C).",,"White

Americans are roughly 20 points more likely than African Americans,

and 10-15 points more likely than Hispanic Americans, to highly

rate their local police departments for effectiveness. (See

Appendix C for full breakdowns.) For instance, while 60% of white

Americans think police effectively protect people from crime, only

38% of African Americans and 49% of Hispanics agree. Similarly

about 6 in 10 whites think the police do a good job enforcing the

law and responding quickly, compared to 4 in 10 blacks and less

than half of Latinos.","Perceptions of police competency strongly correlate with

ideology. Seventy-eight percent (78%) of respondents who identify

crime, only 35% of very liberal respondents agree.","Education, income, and age are also related to perceptions of

police efficacy. College graduates (67%), households earning

$60,000+ a year (69%), and seniors (72%) give the police high

high school graduates (55%), households earning less than $30,000 a

year (54%), and millennials (53%) agree.36 Suburban

residents (62%) are somewhat more likely than urban residents (53%)

to believe the police are effective at enforcing the law.","In sum, Americans who are older, higher income, conservative,

white, and living in the suburbs are the most likely to believe the

police are good at their jobs. Conversely, individuals who are

younger, lower income, liberal, African American or Hispanic, and

living in urban neighborhoods are least confident that the police

are competent. (See Appendix D for full breakdowns.)  ","Evaluations of police competency are highly correlated with

overall favorability toward the police. Among those who give the

police high ratings for protecting people from crime, 83% have a

favorable view of local law enforcement, compared to 27% among

those who have low confidence in police competency.37","Nearly six

authority defer to police and are thus less likely to incur verbal

abuse.","To investigate, the author created a Respect for Authority Index

(RAI), a composite scale based on averaging responses to three

without explicitly asking about police. (See Appendix E for

question wording.) A higher RAI score indicates a respondent is

more apt to respect authority figures. Higher RAI scores are not

direct measures of deference to the police, but rather indicate a

higher likelihood of deference.","Individuals

with a higher RAI score are less likely to report police swearing

at them; however, this finding primarily holds for white Americans.

Among whites, those with low RAI scores are 3 times as likely as

whites with high RAI scores to report experience with police

deferential toward the police may have better experiences, whereas

belief that police are biased should affect public opinion about

the police. Individuals might see the system as biased in general

but not toward them. Alternatively, they might believe the system

is both biased in general and toward them. This report investigates

both perceptions.","Fully

58% of Americans say the criminal justice system fails to treat all

individuals equally, including 45% who believe the system gives

preference to white Americans and 13% who think the system treats

black and Hispanic Americans better. Less than half (42%) of

Americans believe the justice system is impartial. However, a

majority (56%) give their local police departments high marks for

partisanship. About half (49%) of white Americans believe the

criminal justice system treats everyone about the same. Only 17% of

black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans agree. Instead, a

strong majority (72%) of African Americans, a slim majority of

Hispanics (51%), and 40% of Caucasians believe the justice system

gives preferences to whites. About 1 in 10 black and white

Americans and 2 in 10 Hispanic Americans think the justice system

offers greater leniency to minorities.","More

than two-thirds (69%) of Democrats say the system favors whites

over blacks and Hispanics while 21% say the system treats everyone

equally. But, 64% of Republicans say the system treats everyone the

same while 21% think the system is biased in favor of whites.

Independents are divided: 45% think the system is fair, and 41%

think the system gives preference to Caucasians.","Here again, race matters more than partisanship. Although white

Republicans (67%) are 41 points more likely than white Democrats

(26%) to believe the system treats everyone equally, black

Republicans (15%) are about as likely as black Democrats (13%) to

think the system is impartial. Hispanics fall in between, with

Hispanic Republicans 28 points more likely than Hispanic Democrats

to believe the system is fair (45% vs. 17%).43 Ultimately,

white Republicans are the only group that solidly believes the

justice system treats all citizens fairly.","These data indicate partisan ideology is correlated with

perceptions of impartiality in the justice system, but primarily

for whites and Hispanics. Hispanic and white Republicans are both

more likely than Hispanic and white Democrats to believe the system

is fair. However, black Republicans and black Democrats have

may have different personal or vicarious experiences with the

police.","Local Police Departments These

confidence gaps extend to evaluations of local police departments.

While 64% of white Americans highly rate their local police for

impartiality, only 31% of African Americans and 42% of Hispanics

agree.44 Republicans (78%) are also

considerably more likely than Democrats (40%) and independents

(57%) to highly rate their local police for impartiality.","Urban

residents (47%) are also less likely than suburban (62%) and rural

residents (59%) to believe the police treat all groups the same.

This pattern generally holds across racial groups: whites living in

suburbs are about 19 points more likely than whites living in

cities to highly rate their local police for impartiality (70% vs.

51%). Suburban Hispanics (54%) are 14 points more likely than

Hispanics living in cities (40%) to agree. Blacks living in cities

those who highly rate their department for impartiality, 83% have a

favorable view of the police.45 However, only 31% of

those who are not confident of such impartiality have a favorable

view.","Personal

Bias","Although most Americans believe the justice system suffers from

bias, 75% expect the police will treat them the same as anyone else

for a traffic violation or minor offense. Ten percent (10%) of

Americans think police would treat them worse than other people,

and 15% expect they would be treated better.","Majorities of black (60%), Hispanic (60%), and white (77%)

Americans personally expect to receive equal treatment from police.

However blacks and Hispanics comprise a disproportionate share of

those who expect worse treatment. African Americans (32%) are about

five times more likely, and Hispanics (13%) twice as likely, as

white Americans (6%) to expect worse treatment.","Notably,

although only a third of African Americans and 42% of Hispanics

highly rate their police departments for impartiality, majorities

of both groups (60% and 72% respectively) believe they

personally would be treated the same as other

people.46 This suggests that expectations about

personal treatment are not sufficient to explain perceptions of

bias in the department overall.","Predictably, those who expect to receive equal treatment are

more favorable toward the police than those who expect worse

treatment by a margin of 70% to 29%.","Taking

these results together, Americans are more likely to perceive

racial bias in the criminal justice system overall than at the

level of their local police department. They are least likely to

expect to personally be treated inequitably. Ultimately,

perceptions of systemic bias more strongly and negatively correlate

with favorability toward the police than do personal expectations.

It is important for people to believe the system is fair

personally experience it? Perhaps an above average concern for

others experiencing harm may lead one to be more apt to believe

charges of racial bias.","To investigate, the author created a Sensitivity to Harm

Index (SHI), based on the Care/Harm Foundation in Moral

Foundations Theory.47 The SHI is a composite scale based on

SHI scores believe the justice system is biased against blacks and

Hispanics compared to 27% among those with low scores.48 Whites who score low on SHI are far

more likely to say the system treats everyone the same than those

who score high (58% vs. 36%). These results suggest that people who

tend to empathize may be more sensitive to charges of racial bias

open to decriminalizing drugs. A majority-54%-support

most demographic groups. However, Americans over 65 are the only

age cohort opposed to legalization, by a margin of 36% to 64%.

Results are reversed among millennials, with 64% in favor and 36%

opposed.","Conservatives

stand out as highly opposed to marijuana legalization by a margin

of 64% to 36%. Conversely, solid majorities of Liberals (79%)

Libertarians (69%), and a slim majority of Communitarians (53%),

favor legalizing marijuana and regulating it like alcohol.102","Similarly, most groups favor re-categorizing drug offenses from

felonies to civil offenses. There are a few exceptions: a slim

majority of women (52%) oppose decriminalizing drugs, while 59% of

men favor. Similarly 55% of seniors oppose, but 56% of Americans

under 65 favor decriminalization. Conservatives strongly oppose

(64%) decriminalizing drug offenses. In contrast, Liberals (74%)

and Libertarians (67%) solidly support it, while Communitarians are

evenly divided (50%).","This report has examined public support for reforms police

departments could implement in efforts to improve relations with

their communities. However, some Americans believe that their

fellow citizens, not the police, are primarily responsible for

strained relations. They believe too few people show adequate

should improve their behavior first. For instance, one online

would have been prevented if the person would have shown respect to

or flee. We need to better support our officers and not try to

only 5% say their jobs are not very dangerous. 103 In

addition, most Americans (58%) believe their fellow citizens show

systemic problems in policing. Americans give high marks to local

law enforcement for enforcing the law (59%), using the appropriate

amount of force (58%), being courteous (57%), being honest (57%),

protecting people from violent crime (56%), treating all racial

groups equally (56%), responding quickly to a call for help (56%),

and caring about their community (55%). Furthermore, 54% believe

officers are generally held accountable for misconduct when it

occurs. (See Appendix B for a full breakdown.)","If people a) believe police are in a dangerous line of work, b)

believe citizens disrespect the police, and c) do not perceive

systemic problems in law enforcement-it becomes less surprising

citizens do have violent interactions; some have latterly become

rhetorical war. For instance, Heather MacDonald argues in her

recent book The War on Cops that the war is due

lower today than in the past. 106","Although people across racial and partisan groups believe the

police have dangerous jobs, they disagree about whether police are

disrespected or are under attack.","White Americans are 20-30 points more likely than African

(64% vs. 34%) and to believe there is a war on police (64% vs.

46%). Hispanics fall in between with a plurality (45%) who say

believe there is a war on police. In contrast, majorities of

African Americans say there is no war on police (54%) and that

officers receive adequate respect (54%).","Partisanship also matters. Republicans are about 30-40 points

adequate deference (77% vs. 45%) and to believe the police are

under attack (82% vs. 40%). Independents lean with Republicans,

and 56% who believe there is a war on police.",,,"Again, race

matters more than partisanship. White Republicans are the most

they are nearly 30 points more likely than white Democrats to feel

this way (81% vs. 51%). However, black Republicans are no more

likely than black Democrats to agree (35% vs. 39%).107 Older Americans are also more

concerned for police than younger Americans. Seniors (78%) are 33

points more likely than millennials (45%) to think the police

more likely than millennials to believe that a war is being waged

on cops (76% vs. 55%).","Unsurprisingly, the Respect for Authority Index (RAI) is highly

correlated with concern about people respecting police.108 Three-fourths (76%) of those who

the respect they deserve, compared to only 35% of those who have a

offers lessons to criminal justice reformers. Many people have had

problems in policing. Such people might assume that citizens

instigate conflict with the police. Some people greatly trust

authority figures like the police whom they see as the ultimate

linchpin of societal order. People with such experience and views

of authority may see intensifying criticism of the police and

as an attack on police legitimacy, and thereby, law and order.","As they seek to persuade their fellow citizens, reformers should

consider the implications of this analysis. Has their audience

generally had positive or negative interactions with the police? Do

they have a propensity to trust authority figures? If so, reformers

should present evidence that speaks directly to these experiences

and assumptions. Reformers might indicate their shared commitment

to helping police to promote law and order. They can then explain

how their reforms will accomplish these goals and improve police

safety and police-community relations.","Black, white, and Hispanic Americans see the police differently.

They differ about police efficacy, impartiality, honesty, empathy,

tactics, and accountability. Their views may vary in part because

Hispanic, black, and white Americans report considerably different

personal and vicarious experiences with police officers. For

instance, some groups are more likely to report verbal or physical

abuse from officers. Taken together, these disparate perceptions

and reported experiences form a deep divide in favorability toward

law enforcement.","However, many overlook agreement among these groups. Americans

across race and ethnicity agree on what policing should be and on

which reforms should be adopted.","Blacks, whites, and Hispanics all agree on the top priorities

for law enforcement, maintaining current levels of policing

presence in their communities, and the danger inherent in police

work. Majorities of Hispanic, white, and black Americans also

support a variety of police reforms: more training, body cameras,

warnings to citizens about stops and searches, and independent

investigations of alleged police misconduct. Similarly, majorities

oppose a variety of possible police practices: racial profiling,

routine use of military weapons and armored vehicles, pretextual

vehicle stops to search for drugs without a warrant, seizing

personal and private property before a person is convicted of a

crime (civil asset forfeiture), and officers swearing at citizens.

Majorities also support decriminalizing drug offenses from felony

to civil charges, a change that might improve interactions between

police and citizens.","Americans may consider police reforms without perceiving all

possible problems and systemic biases in policing. Reformers need

not insist that others agree with, and adopt their perceptions of

policing today. Instead, by acknowledging concerns and emphasizing

shared beliefs about what policing ought to be, reformers can forge

a consensus to improve policies on behalf of officers, citizens,

and the larger community.",,Notes:,Notes:,"1 In

By Chris Francescani,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Public disclosures about U.S. government surveillance threaten the ability of police to use powerful new technologies such as drones and mobile license plate readers, a top law enforcement official said on Sunday.","The leak of highly classified documents by National Security Agency Edward Snowden prompted tighter restrictions on key technology advances, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan, speaking at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference.","The disclosures, including about monitoring of U.S. phone records, threaten to erode existing authority to use high-tech equipment, he said.","""The scrutiny that the NSA has come under filters down to us,"" Keenan said at the annual gathering that draws top law enforcement from the United States and elsewhere with workshops, product exhibits and conferences.","He said guidelines for collecting data varied widely from state to state. License plate data is retained for 48 hours to five years, for example, depending on local law, he said.","For many new technologies, there is no clear legal standard to govern their use, he said.","""If we are not very careful, law enforcement is going to lose the use of technology,"" he said.","New technology including advanced facial recognition software, mobile license plate readers and unmanned aircraft are reshaping U.S. law enforcement, officials said.","Such advances will be ""both the benefactor and the curse of policing"" and demand that law enforcement be thoughtful about their deployment, Philadelphia Police Chief Charles Ramsey said on Saturday at the start of the weeklong conference.","""Imagine instead of driving down the street scanning license tags, driving down the street checking the faces of individuals walking down the street,"" Ramsey said.","""We have to remind ourselves - just because we can do something doesn't mean we should do it.""","U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are scheduled to address the roughly 13,500 conference attendees on Monday.",(Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst and Bernard Orr)

1st, the good news - Jerry Smith, Jr. survived this horrific police shooting from the @MilwaukeePolice. He's paralyzed, but survived.



The city fought to keep this video private because the DA there lied and said this was a justified shooting. It's not.pic.twitter.com/NApqRBjzSj","It's well past time for requiring cops to purchase liability insurance just like doctors. As it is, they have no incentive to stop abusing their power.","Take it out of their pensions, and then they will start self enforcing.

As long as Grand Juries exist, they won't even get a trial.

  ","Dallas PD Officer Amber Guyger first said she showed up to #BothamJean's apartment and the door was shut and locked. 



Then she said it was shut but unlocked. 



Now she says it was actually wide open. 



Here a resident of the same building shows that is IMPOSSIBLE. 





It is NOT automatically handed over.","Right, because initially, the Dallas PD didn't consider it an OIS (officer involved shooting) because she was off duty. The Rangers weren't called initially - and when they were called, they didn't want the case for that same reason.","Officer involved shooting investigations in Texas are NOT all automatically handed over to the Texas Rangers.

","An Ohio magistrate has resigned after storming out of his Cincinnati courtroom and chasing down a woman, grabbing her shoulder. The magistrate was presiding over a trial when he heard a commotion coming from the hallway. It was the woman, and she was allegedly screaming at the top of her lungs because she had been told she was 30 minutes late to file court papers. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Michael Bachman walked out of his courtroom to see what was going on.","
