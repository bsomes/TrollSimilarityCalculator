WARNING- NOT CNN APPROVED! MSM says Trump's selfish UN address angered the world, but go to int'l news sites comments and see the truth straight from the people! "America has a strong leader once more," "a credible leader of the free world", "Bless this man and his nation," "Where is our Trump?"
SJWs manage to make United Airlines plane removal incident about race- Thanks Obama!
Shoutout to the brave Pedes fighting on the frontlines, one of you has broken the Twitter algorithm BIGLY!!! His name was Seth Rich!
Redditors on the Bill Nye Saves the World thread at the top of r/all having a wake-up moment about why they are LOSING and will continue to LOSE!!
NEW! Photo of Seth Rich's headstone. "Beloved son, brother, grandson, PATRIOT. He made a difference to others." Never stop fighting for this man Pedes!
To the women leaving maxi pads all over our country- the young ladies in developing nations who have to skip school during their periods because they don't have pads would like a word with you.
Can we take a moment to appreciate patriot James O'Keefe for reminding us what a real JOURNALIST is. Let's make journalism great again!
National Guard troops from Fort Hood rescuing victims in Orange,TX slept in a Walmart parking lot last night and were GRATEFUL for it! Cue the left: "REEE Arpaio made illegal criminals sleep in TENTS, REEE Fort Hood is named after a confederate soldier!!" Thanks again to our brave National Guard!
**COVERUP ALERT: SETH RICH'S TWITTER ACCOUNT Panda4Progress HAS BEEN DELETED**
WHAT IS THIS TIMELINE? Even the political subs are applauding the Trump admin for bringing our NK detained citizens home- "Cheer for the good things and boo the bad. The jerseys don't matter." A shift is happening...
"Maybe if homeless vets just say they're refugees, AirBnB will give them housing and Starbucks will give them a job"
PRAISE KEK, this is YUUUUUGE!!! Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein's Letter to AG Sessions outlining reasons to fire Comey, and the main reason cited is NOT PURSUING PROSECUTION OF HILLARY FOR EMAILS LAST YEAR! The Clinton House of Cards is FALLING!
I present Exhibit A
Pedes, do not let this fall by the wayside! Obama and Dirty Rice wiretapped and unmasked Trump and crew under the guise of MUH RUSSIA investigation, which we now know never even existed in the first place!!!
"The Trump administration is trying to deport as many people as possible, even if they're here legally." Congratulations GQ, on the most poisonous and blatant fake news I have seen in quite some time!
REMINDER: According to Huffpo in 2014, 80% of Central American women and girls are RAPED during their border crossing attempts. Why isn’t the MSM showing this reality among all their human interest story coverage of the caravan?
You mean to tell me Staples employees worked overtime Saturday night to be able to get thousands of professionally printed signs, banners, and shirts ready for today's protests? The stench of SETUP is overwhelming...
GOOD MORNING MR PRESIDENT! "The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!"
Wow!!! First time I have seen anyone in the liberal media actually taking responsibility for why they LOST without blaming the Russians!!! Historic!
NEW MUH RUSSIA ALERT! Cuckbook (who for months said no Russian agents bought ads) suddenly discovers 3000 ads about "divisive topics" like LGBT and immigration bought by a "Russian troll farm to influence the election." Shockingly, they refuse to turn the evidence over to Congress!
There have been a lot of violent crimes streamed live on media recently, but let's not forget the one that rules them all
Minneapolis taxpayers brace for Super Bowl with armed F-16s and Black Hawks and thousands of extra police on the ground due to “potential extremist threats from the city’s Somali community.” PART AND PARCEL!!!
When even r/all wakes up to the dumpster fire that is CNN. We don't even have to do anything except continue to MAGA, the left will eventually destroy itself!
Redditors in a non-political sub circle-jerking themselves about Trump's "racist" policies towards immigrants, an actual minority third-world immigrant shows up to defend Trump, gets downvoted and attacked. The tolerant left everyone, they know what's better for you than you do!
President of South Korea credits Trump for historic Korean meeting but some liberals on Reddit can’t. Trump Derangement Syndrome is real... come join us at T_D for the cure!
Oh Lordy! These CNN interviews did NOT age well!!!
This is the America Dems have created- Images from Lib protesters attacking Trump supporters today at the Huntington Beach rally.. unbelievable
MSM continues to show its relevance. Huge story: TRUMP STRUGGLES WITH UMBRELLA IN WIND. Minor stories: NK denuclearizes and Dems slander a Cabinet nominee and ruin his life
"Dreamers are just kids who want to MAGA?" WRONG!!! In 2012, 62% of all illegal households were on welfare, but a staggering 87% of illegal households with kids were on welfare! DACA kids/anchor babies are illegal parents' insurance policies to stay and drain our welfare programs. Do not concede!!!
Starbucks to close 8,000 stores for an afternoon to conduct racial bias training. Lesson one: “Black” coffee will henceforth be referred to as “coffee of color.”
Why isn't this story everywhere?! Equifax data breach exposed 143 MILLION American social security #s, names, addresses, and DOB's! Breach announced 3 months after discovery! Equifax managers dumped stock before announcing! Social security abuse for ID theft/welfare/voting is going to SKYROCKET!
Tucker guest Wendy Osefo: "Now we are finding out about a THIRD meeting between Sessions and Russia." Tucker: "Do you have proof that this meeting happened?" Osefo: "Do you have proof that it DIDN'T?" Russia investigation in a nutshell....
Infuriating!!! Navy veteran in San Diego gets laid off and can't pay her bills, commits suicide barely a month later. Hey Cuckifornia, why aren't veterans as important to you as illegals?
My favorite moment from Comey’s post-firing testimony... I wonder if Trump regretted firing such a qualified FBI Director?
Comey: "After the secret meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch, I considered a special counsel into the email investigation. Instead I dropped it." WTF?????????
Pedes, this needs attention!!! Italian prosecutors have evidence of NGO's/charities colluding with Arab smugglers to use refugee rescue vessels for slave trafficking- black African and Christian economic migrants are being collected and enslaved by Muslims, many have been killed!!!
Hahahaha, Jennifer "Hurricane's are God's punishment for electing Trump" Lawrence's movie is a total bomb, making $13.4 million on a $30 million budget. Keep speaking with your wallets pedes!!!
SPOT THE NPC!
President of Planned Parenthood: "Dreamers can still get an abortion with us!" Translation- Sending illegal immigrants home = heartless/cruel, Killing their kids = a-okay.
POTUS and FLOTUS, 2005. Forever grateful for you giving up your fairytale life in service to our country!
SOMEONE has edited, deleted, and continues to delete months worth of Seth Rich's Reddit comments.. Blatant violation of 18 U.S. Code § 1512 - Tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant. We are watching a crime happen before our eyes.
HAHA CNN TOTALLY BTFO by Syrian chemical attack victim on live TV when they tried to make him criticize Trump and support Clinton! "Immigration ban marchers are hypocrites, if you really care, help us stay in our country!"
REMINDER: Google seeded Crowdstrike w/ $100 mill investment- Crowdstrike blamed Sony "hack" on N Korea and DNC "hack" on Russia. Which story sells more cybersecurity products: disgruntled internal leaker, or hostile foreign state threats? Ps Crowdstrike is now worth $1 billion two years later.
Whoa! California pilot gets life in prison for trafficking Filipino children. Could this be related to Vegas shooter/pilot Stephen Paddock and his Filipino wife?
We will not let their sacrifices be for nothing! Happy Memorial Day Pedes! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Seth Rich's comment history is officially being edited and large amount of comments are deleted- WHY?
My serious question to every pede saying to stop speculating and wait for Vegas shooting facts to come out: Where have you been the past 12 months/couple years??? Do NOT stop questioning this, it is the most important thing we can do.
This is getting alarming Pedes- Seth Rich's family has written to Hannity asking him to stop pushing "false conspiracy theories" about the "reasons for Seth's death." The wording in this letter is frightening, they've gotten to the family.
His name was Xavier Jugele. A 37 yr old Paris police officer who responded to the Bataclan ISIS massacre in 2015 AND the reopening a year later, with a vow to defend France's civil liberties against terrorists. He was murdered by an Islamic terrorist yesterday. We will never forget you.
It was only a matter of time! Harvey Weinstein raping women over the past 3 decades and Hollywood protecting him is now Trump's fault!
ALL OF SETH RICH's KNOWN AND SUSPECTED SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS- DIG DIG DIG
Suspected Trump supporter Taylor Swift drops new single that has triggered the salt-left! Album cover takes dig at fake news media, single "Look What You Made Me Do" lyrics imply she's sick of the industry's shit, and lyrics video has blatant pedo/pizza symbols!
NOT A JOKE: ESPN does "fantasy football sketch" auctioning off a black man to a group of white men-Democrats back in their element folks!
Pedes, it is OFFICIALLY HAPPENING! Andrew Therriault DNC Director of Data Science for Hillary puts her on BLAST for blaming the DNC, then quickly deletes tweets. How soon before they all start turning on eachother?!?!?!
Assange's Wikileaks publishes DNC leaks. Media blames Russia. Assange (and Russia) denies it's Russia and instead offers large reward to solve Seth Rich's murder. Hannity goes to London and gets rare Assange interview. Hannity is now looking into Seth Rich murder too. WHAT MORE DOES THE DOJ NEED???
Pedes, what do we know about this? In 2009, 69 computers from Los Alamos National Lab “which did not contain classified information” were lost. 2009 also saw a scare in which 2.2 lb of missing plutonium was a result of “miscalculation.” Totally legit, nothing to see here people!
Police:"Although theyre adults, theyre 18. Kids make stupid decisions- they're legally adults, but they're young adults and they make stupid decisions. That will be part of whether we seek a hate crime"
California Penal Code Section 185: "It shall be unlawful for any person to wear any mask... for the purpose of evading... recognition in the commission of any public offense." Berkeley gonna burqa...
Grab em by the front hole?
Trump is just trying to get our country into shape again! 4D Chess all around!
One of my all time favorite GEOTUS shots, especially haunting with the Twin Towers in the distance. Grateful for this man every day!
OUR FIRST FAMILY!
Redditor in my PMs thinks that building the wall is taking away "free education and healthcare for my grandkids" and calls us "Cheeto crumbs." Soon changes tune and is against foreign aid and has hope for Trump. WHAT?
Lucky for you!
HAHAHA, the redpills Comey dropped at the hearing yesterday are starting to digest! 12-year liberal and Trump hater finally got woke. This is what happens when the people get to hear the information straight from the horse's mouth and not through the CNN Agenda Fake News Filter!!!
Seth Rich parents lawsuit says “DNC leaker theory” portrays him as criminal/traitor. Then why not sue Wikileaks for offering reward money to solve his murder? And why did they write “Patriot” and “He made a difference to others” on his grave? SOMETHING DOESNT ADD UP!!!
VERY ODD STORY- Failed false flag? Texas couple arrested with large weapons/gear stash in Massachusetts hotel on Sunday says they were on “classified government mission,” yet they called police themselves when their video feed of their room cut out and they thought someone was breaking in
KellyAnne Couchgate- This buried pic tells the real story. She did not want to stand up and block the official photographer but wanted to take a photo too so she squatted on the couch to get the shot... Why is this a headline dominating story???
[UPDATED] Pedes, I have found info regarding Imran Awan's potential family connection and it's huge if true. Please help me confirm and spread this lead.
Bill Mitchell- "You can't fix America without pissing off the people who broke it"
Pedes- I was contacted by a source here last week after we found all the Seth Rich accounts begging us to get focus back on the leads that fbianon is leading us to. The key is the Clinton Foundation, which will unravel everything else. Sources and explanation in comments.
THE HYPOCRISY!!! Trump supporting realtor FIRED after joke tweet referencing Patton Oswalt's late wife after he supported un-American Sally Yates. How come "it's just a joke!" only works if you're a LIB?
The State of the Union- Leftists ready to elect David Hogg as President
Don’t worry, the Republicans, and your President, will fix it!
The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?
There were literally dozens of cameras pointed at you live. We all saw you, bro.
Some parties take longer than others
China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.
Trump has lived rent-free in Obama’s head since the epic elevator ride.
Greet Wilders Announces ‘Draw Muhammad’ Contest Just Before Ramadan Ends
This man wouldn’t last a day on Twitter.
If Dana Loesch were liberal, the press would be full of stories about the vicious, misogynist things being said of her.
What happened to the b.j. allegations against Spartacus Gropicus??
The good guy won
....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!
Christine Ford, vacationing in Bali, was unavailable for comment
Sean Hannity wakes up early to tell us that James Comey is screwed. How do I know? My President tweeted me this morning and told me to watch Fox a few minutes ago. I have stellar communication with my President!
This is awkward.
He's a legend in his own mind
Sanity reigns.
Two tiered justice system.
Wholeheartedly agree
I love this restaurant owners response! Jane Fonda, what a crazy bitch!

CONFIRMED: Sarah Sanders Is One Of The 10 Most Admired Women In America
Let’s not do a shutdown, Democrats - do what’s right for the American People!
Never in the history of our Country has the “press” been more dishonest than it is today. Stories that should be good, are bad. Stories that should be bad, are horrible. Many stories, like with the REAL story on Russia, Clinton & the DNC, seldom get reported. Too bad!
ALL-TIME RECORD OPTIMISM!
Lock him up now and ask the questions later.
Darn straight! Remove the gun-free zones & it’ll be 💯 %!
Another losing issue Democrats are hitching their electoral wagons to.
I often stated, “One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.” This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!
Let's just hope they didn't find any plastic straws on him or he'll be facing the chair...
As only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn’t the FBI or Department of “Justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me!
Not surprisingly, the media is not celebrating this great economic news. If you are black; do not go back!
She has to go back.
Imagine the unity America would feel if they put differences aside and stood together for their country. We would be unstoppable!!!
This is exactly what happens when you hire based on diversity instead of skills.
Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea. Things are going very well, time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set. Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.
"How dare you assert that I should have to pull my own weight? I demand free money, free phones, and free healthcare. Also you're a racist." - Democrats 2018.

“This demonstrates the Robert Mueller and his partisans have no evidence, not a whiff of collusion, between Trump and the Russians. Russian project legal. Trump Tower meeting (son Don), perfectly legal. He wasn’t involved with hacking.” Gregg Jarrett. A total Witch Hunt!
He is trying to pretend that France’s problems have nothing to do with him. So predictable.
Jon Tester will say anything, AND DO ANYTHING, to maintain his position in the Senate. DO NOT FORGET, he is the ranking member on the committee for Veterans Affairs. Kick this guy to the curb Montana!
Welcome back CJ!
He's a true American hero.
Sad how uninformed people are by design. Time to address this msm propaganda machine.
Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.
More proof they're NPC's. Coding error.
Quick, someone get the oxygen for Pelosi and Schumer.
We’re sorry, illegal invaders. This nation is currently closed.
Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!
Senator Tim Scott is praising the Trump Administration for bringing down African American unemployment.
I'm thinking the latter.
"Hate facts"
Dear God help him.
No, Stacey Abrams did not win in Georgia. Democracy did just fine.
Baltimore School District Can’t Heat Schools But Are Sending 60 Busloads of Kids to Anti-Gun March with Free T-Shirts and Meals. Sad!

“Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN” @foxandfriends FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.
They’re not new voters!
And bombard the Clintons with questions about their vast criminality!
Avenatti respects his daughter so much that when she was 15 he dragged her to his wife’s house to act as a witness and screamed on the front lawn for an hour until cops came while she was visibly terrified.
Tell me about it. A "parent" that drags their kids across the border illegally is At Least responsible for child abuse in this case.
He. Is. The. President. You. Are. Not.
Trump: I would have run into school during shooting even without a gun
Can't say bread winner either, it might offend people who can't have gluten.
After he admitted that he himself received docs from Ohr. But was then told he couldn't say that. What!?
Not looking good for the dynamic duo…
They will all PAY for what they did to Flynn.
And it can. Stop dragging kids through the desert to illegally enter the country.
Delta CEO Desperately Tries to BACKPEDAL on Guns After Losing $50 Mil Tax Break
Strzok and Page probably wrote his speech for him.
Yup! Hence, no DACA plan until November. They need to leverage this to get votes. Cheap shot for those DACA recipients waiting for answers.
"For all who put on the uniform, and all who keep the home fires burning. Merry Christmas!" 🇺🇸️ Remember our Veterans
Couldn't agree more.
Your policies led to the Parkland massacre, so zip it.
Senator, this is a troubling message that excludes and diminishes half the population of the young people in America. I strongly encourage you re-evaluate your priorities on this.
Bernie Sanders' campaign got foreign help....from THE AUSTRALIANS per the FEC which has fined the campaign.

They don’t have to wait in Mexico. They can return to their own country and wait thereeeeeeeeeeeeee.

After more than 10 years, I believe these are the 6 greatest moments in the MCU
FINALLY!
It‘s quite funny to think that both of this is happening in the same universe just a few blocks away
In 2019 when Bond 25 comes out, Daniel Craig will be 13 years in the character of James Bond, surpassing Roger Moore, who was the greatest spy for 12 years (1973-1985)
Anyone else feels that "The Hateful Eight" (2015) is the most Tarantino-ish movie since his debut movies?
Edge of Tomorrow is such a brilliant movie
Endgame must truly feel like the End of an Era for the original Avengers!
It's ironic how Dunkirk goes completely without gore and graphic violence, and still happens to be one of the most distressing and claustrophobic war movies
Honestly, Chicanery (S3E5) is one of the most clever written, outstandingly acted and well directed TV episodes I have seen
Oh Spidey
If there is one thing I want to see in Bond 25, it's Bond not going rogue.
Am I the only one who thinks this shot of „Bingo“ (S1E7) looks like a Neo-Noir shot?
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the best blockbusters ever
In most trailers the villain is destroying enemies, cars, buildings and entire planets, but in DaDe S3 trailer Wilson Fisk just showers and it‘s the most intimidating thing ever imo
One of the greatest MCU scenes ever! The sheer amount of blood, gore and violence, all shot in a practically flawless moving rhythm is beyond my wildest imagination!
Daredevil keeps topping itself! Everyone talked about the great Hall Way One Take from Season One. Then came the stunning Stair Way Long Take in Season Two. And now we have a 10 minute long take prison escape fighting scene. The show is in a league of its own!
Arrival (2016) is so damn fantastic! What a mind-blowing experience!
Man, this opening scene of Sabrosito (S3E4) really touched my Breaking Bad heart!
The greatest moments of all 3 Seasons of Daredevil!
In Bruges is such a fantastic comedy

That Daredevil (Matt) vs. Daredevil (Dex) fight scene in Daredevil S3E6 is absolutely breathtaking! This show keeps getting better and better
One reason I like Deadpool 2 more than Deadpool is that it goes completely nowhere
After watching the first episode of Mad Men, the one thing that amazes me the most isn't that the show looks like its set in 1960s, it looks like it's completely shot in the 1960s. If I didn't know that it started 2007, I could have easily guessed it was filmed during Connerys first Bond movies.
Anyone else thinks that Johnny English 1 & 2 are really entertaining movies and is hyped for Johnny English Strikes Again this year?
Sequels better than the original?

If there's one thing I want to see in Bond 25, it's no more Bond goes Rogue
Tragic, we should‘ve seen it coming
The ending of Blade Runner 2049: „Born“ Dr Ana Steline watches artificial snow, while K (Ryan Gosling), a replicant is lying in real snow and experiencing life. Such a wonderful metaphor for humanity. Its not where you come from, but you‘re experiences of life that make you human
The more I think about it, the funnier does Martin McDonaghs "In Bruges" get
Why is Bran always looking like he smoked the best weed in all of Westeros?
Creed (2015) may not be the most original or unpredictable movie to come around, but it‘s a love letter to movie fans

Anyone else feels that Insidious 1-3 is actually a pretty solid and good horror trilogy?
[SPOILERS] In my opinion, Season 4 of Games of Thrones is the single greatest achievement in television history.
This has probably been said a million times but I just finished the first Season of TD and it‘s really one of the greatest, maybe the greatest, TV Season I have ever seen
The Nice Guys (2016) is a really great crime/neo-noir comedy! I feel like its not getting the appreciation it should.

Roger Ver wants to keep Bitcoin technology as close as possible to its original version from 10 years ago. If Apple or Tesla had the same mindset they would never be where they are now. That's why i believe under Roger Ver Bitcoin will never innovate further.
Our aim for mainnet should be Gemini exchange which could also get XTZ listed on Nasdaq
Nasdaq is open to becoming cryptocurrency exchange, CEO says
This is how you get on major exchanges like @coinbase and @GeminiDotCom. If you want real value in advancement there is no other option. #Tezos is playing it smart. #XTZ will fly high long term.

NASDAQ SOURCE: "The listing of several coins will happen in 2019..." Nasdaq and Gemini have gotten very comfortable with each other. Tezos is part of Winklevosscapital, do you see Tezos on Nasdaq in 2019?

The Tezos mission to the moon starts today, Tezos To The Moon soundtrack
Does this put Tezos at number 1 regarding on chain governance?
As someone who's still learning about Bitcoin, this is the best explanation i've seen and made me realize how big of a deal Bitcoin is
When can we vote on zk-snarks using the governance mechanism?
Tezos halving coming in January? 62.9 million XTZ will be frozen instead of todays 38.3 million
Looking at Tzscan watching the delegations in action is amazing, it's like im in the future, millions of USD worth of Cryptocurrency are being assigned from around the globe to another person in an instant to earn dividents. On a global level this starts to change things.
Looking forward to the XTZ lunch party

Happy Easter guys!
This has been said before, but it needs to be said again: Cryptocurrency needs to decouple from BTC. Now.
An important reminder from one of the greatest minds in Crypto.
Remember: Bitcoin Cash is solving a problem Core has failed to solve for 6 years. It is urgently needed as a technical solution, and has nothing to do with "Roger" or "Jihan".
Coinbase: "Give us the right to run your credit report or your account will be cancelled". Couldn't proceed past login without Accepting new User Agreement.
At CHASE bank and figured, why not...
"F BANKS" wasn't approved.
The Bitcoin community is so far gone...
San Diegans be like: “At least it’s not snowing”.
Steve Jobs: "You have to start with the customer experience, and work backwards to the Technology. What benefits can we give to the customer? Not "Lets sit down with the engineers and discuss our awesome technology".
No words ....
Any US Citizens here moving to Puerto Rico to take advantage of the 0% Capital Gains incentive program?
All the Bitcoin leaders have now told people to just use Banking, Fiat, and Credit Cards. Its tempting to assume they've been bought off by Banks. More likely they're just grossly unqualified to be running the Bitcoin project.
Coinbase: "All outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those Bitcoin". Everybody needs to see this. Moving coins is reported as a taxable capital gain, even if you never cash out. I'm done with Coinbase.
Gemini shuts down BTC transfers due to insane transaction backlog. Thanks Core.

New DNA Blood Test can tell you every virus you've ever had, from among the 206 viruses known to infect humans.
Want consumer adoption? Make them want Bitcoin. Here's how:
Anyone else noticing the new "technique" at play? Tons of new threads intentionally mentioning "BTU" in the title? Manipulative psychology to get people to disassociate BU from "BTC" in their minds entirely...
Core has failed to scale Bitcoin. An entire year after its release, SegWit has failed to pass 35% adoption. SW was too little, too late, and the industry didn't want it.
It arrived just in time for Christmas!
Andreas Antonopoulos: If @Bitcoin twitter account has been stolen, it should be returned to its rightful owner.
Even those inside Core are starting to wake up... (GitHub Conversation Excerpt)

Yes, bitcoin is under attack. From high fees, slow transactions, and an unwilling dev team. Finding a solution to that isn’t an “attack”.
Why I as a Merchant simply can't recommend BTC to my customers. (even though I want to)
$12.50 to $0.54. Hang in there guys.

The first level of Core copouts was "You're not paying high enough fees". The next level of Core copouts is "Dont complain. You're the ones blocking Segwit". There's no winning.
"Being insanely conservative at the cost of the health of the network is the opposite of being conservative."
"Bitcoin is uncorrelated with just about all other assets. Every prudent portfolio manager should thus consider it." (Erik Voorhees)
Bitmain to burn 12% of BCH mining fees: "We believe Bitcoin Cash holders should profit from the growth of BCH by their continued stake in the ecosystem"
Remember the narrative here: We are passionate about fixing Bitcoin. Not replacing it. Phrasing is important.
Dear Core proponents: We are claiming “BCH is Bitcoin” conceptually. Not literally... yet. Understand the difference.
Over 220 Bitcoin Cash bumper stickers will be on the back of 220 cars in 15 countries by next week. And that's just from Day 1. Keep the requests coming!
Clarification: Is a centralized, VC funded, for-profit company really influencing Bitcoin protocol code by hiring core developers, or is that FUD?
Multiple sclerosis patient walks after taking HIV drugs.
Medical Marijuana Industry pouring millions into armored trucks and security vaults. Why aren't they just using Bitcoin?
Over 500 upvotes on a thread mocking Bitcoin as a peer to peer cash payment system for daily, real-life, legal transactions. BTC's own followers are too ignorant to realize they're killing it.
Important time sensitive BTC transaction and I've been sitting here 40 minutes without even 1 confirmation. Thanks Core.
The worst anti-BCH trolls aren’t Bitcoiners. They’re Litecoiners.
I wonder how long it will take for the other sub to finally realize they did too little, too late?
To all those who were dicks while the price was rising:
Don’t be fooled by the new Core troll narrative here: “I love BCH! Core sucks! But BCH probably shouldn’t take the bitcoin name...“
Oh. Are you r/bitcoin chaps finally realizing what’s happened to your community?
The Core developers are either Maliciously motivated, Grossly incompetent, or Completely out of touch. Which is it?
Steve Jobs: "You have to start with the customer experience, and work backwards to the Technology. What benefits can we give to the customer? Not "Lets sit down with the engineers and discuss our awesome technology".
More "Western Union" ads in DC :)
Today I feel empowered.
Bill Gates already has a digital payments solution in mind, and its not Bitcoin...
Bitcoin Cash is Satoshi’s Bitcoin.
LOL these people crack me up. Now we are the "Corporate Takeover of Bitcoin".
Everyone should contact Bitstamp & other major exchanges & suggest they switch to 101 now that Coinbase has.
Merchants like myself could use a Bitcoin Accepted Here badge for our stores that includes the word "Cash" in green. Can someone spearhead an official design?
Satoshi wanted the Bitcoin community to vote on what the Dev team does. We are supposed to be the miners.
Previously skeptical wealth management advisor be like...
I think it’s time we start calling into question the qualifications of the people running the Bitcoin project.
It still absolutely kills me that my bank (and accounts) are "closed" right now...
Where did Bitcoin Classic suddenly appear from?
Two lost puppies found. Please upvote. Instagram username (not me) for contact in image. Verification appreciated (photos on phone etc).
Please vote: Vinny Lingham asks Twitter if Civic (CVC) should switch to BCH-backed platform.
OpenBazaar Founder: “If you support a community which deletes thousands of comments expressing dissenting opinion, don’t talk to me about “misleading newcomers”
From here forward: Employment conflict of interest should never be tolerated in the Bitcoin Dev circle again.
Coinbase: "All outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those bitcoin." Everybody needs to see this. They label transfers as taxable capital gains. Even if you never cash out. I'm done with Coinbase.
Bitcoin Core (BTC) is building "Commercial Banking 2.0". Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a Currency that will Bank the Unbanked, Disrupt Finance, and onboard the poorest in the world to a new financial system without 3rd parties.
“I don’t mind Bitcoin Cash, I just don’t like it stealing the Bitcoin name” <— what?
Seems legit...
Since BitPay apparently uses Bitstamps price, merchants can now hold all income in BTC without worry!
Remember back when you would've killed for the days of $260 Bitcoins?
Free Bitcoin Bumper Sticker to first 500 who request.
Someone should start documenting how many "Redditors for 4 days" are promoting the narrative that bitcoin should not be a cheap, frictionless currency on the other sub.
Is Blockstream’s Goal to Generate Profit or Increase the Value of Bitcoin?
Previously skeptical Wealth Management Advisor acknowledges post-Brexit, Bitcoins growing reputation as new asset class in his industry. (Voice mail left for me today).
R3 apparently has never dealt with the Honey Badger before.
An interesting set of unexpected kinks in a Bitcoin merchant transaction by a new adoptee. Circle / BitPay.
ICON (ICX) Partners With Massive Accounting Firm, Deloitte's Startup Advisory Group
ICON: Projects that liquidated to fiat should’ve raised money in fiat. We’ll diversify to many cryptos to [fund our project and] ensure the industry’s long term growth, We grow together.
Guys don’t even bother with Giacomo. He’s so far gone in cliché Core delusion land its pointless.
Circle Banning New Random Customers We Send to Them...
Core devs admit Satoshi and the White Paper actually matter.
Multiple new fake accounts on r/bitcoin talking to eachother insulting BCH to influence noobs.
Bitcoin is now below my first bitcoin purchase price. I made $230,000 and then lost $240,000 since August 2017.

Geelong’s statement on Tim Kelly
She was found in a dumpster. 4 months later she loves snuggles and sleeps in my bed.
Tony Ferguson the type of guy to pass the water temple on zelda - ocarina of time and count it as a W.
Short memories
Selwoods free kick. Take the emotion out of it, love him or hate him that simply cannot be overlooked. The time when the cats had all the momentum and Melbourne had barely touched the score board and were giving us every chance to win it. What would you expect from your captain after that?
Gunnar’s post aged well
Hypothetical: you’re an elite player at a club. The time has come, you get the phone call. You’re a little unsure what to do. You’ve been chosen for the players playlist this week. What 4 songs would you choose?
Nat fyfe on game day.
My nünzie pie. Someone left her in a dumpster as a kitten. 1 year old now.
Follow menzel on instagram. Noticed he has not put up a parting ways post on instagram about Geelong. Current players have not done the same about menzel which is pretty standard when a player goes else where. I have a feeling cats will grab him in the rookie.

This live sub is the best during games. Currently on a mma one and the banter is just non existent. Zero humor. Can’t wait for next season.
Is it time for Cody to move on from alpha male? let’s say an American top team caliber gym?
Fuck Schaub ey. Like Paulie malignaggi has fucking slammed the decision yet Schaub has the below the belt show. He’s a paid rat just like the judges. First he fucks up the score cards and now won’t back down. Get em boys. I say every gram post slam him.
So I saw a post about a guy predicting the decrease in price. I actually agree with some of the sentiments. I just couldn’t see institutional investors unleashing the hounds yet even at 20k, why would they?
Tfatk squad the moment has happened. Brendan really fucked this one up. It’s all over the internet. Everyone and their dog is pulling him up on this. It’s obvious Schaub is being paid.
Decided to watch big mouth after nick kroll was on the podcast. Did not disappoint. Fuckin funny as m8.

If the Aussie dollar weakens further against the usd and Australia rates drop....will this have a further negative effect on the Australian economy? Hopefully not a silly question but things seem to be a bit shaky right now.

Biggest winner of fury vs wilder was the ufc. Hate him or love him, after the disgrace we saw in boxing tonight kind of makes you appreciate what the ufc and Dana have done. He’s not afraid to call a bad judges decision. Boxing is always fixed, it’s just what exactly the fix is.
Spitting the real truth. Schaub is a showtime cuck
Eskimo bros

Stopped intermittent fasting (frustrated) due to gallbladder attacks. They were increasing to almost 1 every couple of days. Haven’t had one since I stopped.
On a Joe Rogan podcast there is mention of this new stem cell therapy for acl treatment. This treatment has a pretty quick turn around. I believe they mentioned 6 months from complete tear to competing in the olympics for a specific individual. Are any afl clubs doing stem cell therapy?

Two questions. Those with financial knowledge, how concerned are you by the changing percentages banks are expecting housing to decrease by? How concerned should Australia be with low interest rates being effected by overseas interest rates, household debt and 500 billion the interest only issue.

Trade talk episode
I’ve been reading up on some of these rappers getting charged with conspiracy in the u.s. 50 cent said he would rather have a homicide than a conspiracy charge. Not from the u.s, can someone explain this? Why is conspiracy considered worse than homicide?
When at home in Australia I get beard and moustache flakes at the edge of my moustache. When traveling overseas to the u.s or japan I don’t get it. It goes away almost instantly.
Are we seeing the strength of xrp? Currently being used by some banks and hasn’t taken a massive hit.
Got a mate, well traveled from Australia. Visited SF recently and said it was the worst place he has visited in the states and won’t return there. No offense, but this is not the first time I’ve heard people say this. In fact it’s the one city people constantly tell me to avoid. Questions continued

Black Friday, USE MONERO everyone
Broke 140k
Monero is gettin called up to the big leauges, one handshake at a time
Ok Coinbase, Elon.......good day then
When did you last use Monero?
There maybe some confusion as to the upcoming hard fork of Monero and the MoneroV fork.
One of the most powerful Law enforcement officers in the world has come up missing in the same place that Jihan Wu and his companies which control a large percentage of the Bitcoin hashrate are located. the top cop that Interpol is not missing but he was "taken away". Decentralization is a must.
So Big Banks in the US and Britain have banned buying of cryptos with credit cards and India has banned them from its payment systems.
To all watch haters, did yall see this?....lol...good stuff
Ok, im going to say it.
Ive got 154388, anyone else getting excited?

Just noticed that TPB now has an XMR donation address. Never noticed this before.
ShapeShift.io need to step up their game IMO. Evercoin.com's interface is way smoother, and their max deposit is 40 XMR right now compared to 10 XMR at shapeshift. That's FOUR TIMES higher!
Reminder for maximalist Bitcoin HODLers: One great reason to HODL Monero too is that Monero's codebase is 100% independent of Bitcoin's codebase.
Has someone here used Bisq (Bitsquare) to convert between Monero and Bitcoin? Please share your experiences.
Reminder: When ShapeShift.io is out, you can use Evercoin.com
[EARN MONERO] Are you a native German and know how to make SRT subtitle files for videos?
I still do not understand physical Bitcoin coins nor these new physical Monero notes.
xmr.to no longer works with BitPay. Any plans to add "payment protocol" into xmr.to?
1. Is segwit on Monero's roadmap? 2. Will we ever see cross-atomic swaps between Monero <-> Bitcoin or Monero <-> Litecoin?
Is the weak link in Monero *random number generation*? Could those who created the RNGs be collecting all Monero private keys right now as we speak?
As a Monero fan, Andreas just blew my mind. He's making the point that ASIC resistance can lead to more centralization of mining. I want to hear your thoughts. Do you agree with Andreas?
[Earn Easy Monero] Can you supply me with (torrents of) English movies with German dubbed audio + German subtitles? PM me. I'll send you some Monero in exchange for each movie :)

Why do people still think of Bitcoin when you mention the word Blockchain? Because they don’t know any better. Here is an easy chart I found explaining the difference. Video on Blockchain in the comment section below.
We need a LinkedIn Blockchain so we can record real vs. embellished profiles. That way we could stop unsolicited emails from “professionals enthusiasts.” This would definitely improve humanity 😎👍 however in the meantime the comic is pretty funny 😂

Here are some of the uses of Blockchain. The Questions being; which countries will lead in their development and implementation? As a Middle East Expert-I think the following 4; UAE, Israel, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia!
These are great 50 industries, however what about use in the ILLEGAL ARMS TRADE. We know you can confirm illegal black market weapons by tracking serial numbers & origins of location, however that is AFTER the fact. With a developed Blockchain System in place you could track these sales BEFOREHAND!
ABC for consultants and businesses ; If your a consultant then you better be able to ask these questions and if your a business, you better be able to answer them. If the consultant doesn’t ask then get another one and if the business can’t answer, then it needs to replace the project lead.
The Fall of the Lira, The Safety of Bitcoin and Freedom for the Turks. The future is here.
Google's "The Good Censor" and how to Counter Balance It
These are the questions/issues that every Blockchain Consultant needs to think about/present when discussing business opportunities with clients. On the other hand, each business must also have their own internal answers before moving forward.
Will crash of the Turkish Lira lead to Bitcoin Investment?
While these 30 industries are important individually, they will be even more important when integrated. Integrated locally through government support for example, (not control) and internationally as a platform for cross border peace. Already seen in the Middle East and more to follow.

We know from which countries illegal arms flow (Saudi Arabia, China, UAE, Turkey, Pakistan etc) and we know where they originate. So why can't we build a international blockchain supply chain system that can track in whose hands (all too often terrorists) hands they end up in? We can and must!

Forex and Bitcoin Volume Comparison and Political Implications
We constantly think about civilian uses of Blockchain Technology but what about its military application? Each one furthers innovation in respect to the other and thus we need to look at the wider view of Blockchain technology. Understanding the whole leads to future innovations (Use Cases @CSC)
We hear separately and independently about CyberSecurity on one hand and Blockchain Technology on the other. What about the coming together of the two? We need to stop thinking of them as unique unto themselves if we want to fight 21st century cybercrime. I know that I do (Picture HCL Technologies)
“Without Excalibur the Grail cannot be discovered” Isn't it time to go back to the basics of learning what Blockchain is, instead of just speaking about its benefits? We won't get where we want to go if we don't first understand the technology behind the concepts. #Excalibur!

Great "IDC" Chart: Seems to me that all of the top 3 "use cases" can be tied together with the tracking of illegal arms. If the past three days of warfare in the Middle East doesn't show the importance of this, then I don't know what will! Exporter-Importer-Terrorists; How and Why? Track & Learn!
Supply Chain of Arms 1:Primary source of arms=official state stocks. 2:legitimately procured arms are diverted to black market. 3:Terrorist/Criminal Organizations procure arms from corrupt elements. 4:Sold on black market 5:Used in terrorist & criminal acts. 6:create Blockchain to stop steps 2-5
Turkish Unrest and Bitcoin Volume=Regime Troubles
Fake Passports can lead to terrorism, human trafficking and other nefarious actions. A US passport on the Dark Net can be bought for $2000 etc. In the Middle East that Islamic State in 2017 held 11,000 fakes and Bahrain in September caught 14 Iranians in Country with fakes. These are just examples.
Which Blockchain Region Interests you and which countries bookends that region? I go with the Middle East. With bookended countries being the UAE (Dubai 2020) and Israel (The Startup Nation due to its number and success of its technology startups)

Free_Ross on Twitter: "ALL charges of murder-for-hire vs. Ross are now dropped. After almost 5 years, gov't has moved to dismiss final MD indictment based on evidence from corrupt agent now in prison."
Someone hacked the account /u/todu which was a mod here to point users to /r/bitcoin
Former /r/cryptocurrency mod: "I used to be a mod of r/cryptocurrency until they kicked me out. Now, that sub, is controlled all by mods with accounts less than 7 months old!"

A little holiday humor 🎄🎅
Nicholas Merten on Twitter: “It’s really sad to see people accusing me of getting paid or “selling my soul” in crypto by simply taking a photo with Roger Ver. I don’t mean to insult anyone or start conflict, but the sheer disconnect and tribalism of some who’ve joined crypto post-2017 is surreal.”
Just a heads up on what is going on in this sub - please be aware of what is happening. There is a coordinated effort by a specific group to undermine and destroy everything that we support because they are about to lose power come mid-November.
Frances Coppola on Twitter: “Congratulations, Blockstream, you have just reinvented the interbank lending market.”
False Flags, Vote Manipulation, and Trolls
Reddit's /r/btc Reaches 100,000+ Subscribers in a Victory for Censorship Resistance

Twitter Cancels @Bitcoin Account as its CEO Invests in Competing Lightning Network. Is a conflict of interest at play? | Finance Magnates News Article
The @Bitcoin account has been suspended (again) by @TwitterSupport only because Core trolls constantly submit fake reports about it. @Jack why do you guys keep letting this happen? Instead of suspending all the fake scammer accounts you suspend the real ones. WTF.
Bitcoin Cash Mega Thread
Dear extortionist: /r/btc will not be blackmailed by you
Kim Dotcom on Twitter: “Must read: The Bitcoin Cash philosophy by @Falkvinge. [...] Our dream. It’s happening 😎”
Friendly reminder: if you haven't yet, watch this video which shows reddit is gamed and manipulated by professional shills paid by companies with huge million dollar budgets. It is up to our community to defend itself against these bad actors.

This is what we all need. TGIF! :)
Once again Core supporters threaten with lawsuits and government intervention to try to get their way. This is just pathetic and not the foundations of what Bitcoin was built on. These are not bitcoiners.

Gavin's new commentary on Wright situation in email with Dan Kaminsky
Coinbase update: We have observed consensus in the community that the BCH ABC chain will retain the designation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Coinbase will also adopt this designation for BCH.
How Craig Wright is attempting to dishonestly take over the Bitcoin network
The whole point of Bitcoin is to usurp govts & banks and empower people to give them financial freedom. You can’t do that with a tiny network that fights against mass adoption. The smaller the network the easier it’s captured. Bitcoin Cash is the future that I’m fighting for now.
Ryan X. Charles on Twitter: The censorship of /r/bitcoin has had a real, negative effect. A lot of beginners are confused and mislead about the issues.

Bitcoin Cash Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Reddit admins finally chime in on user password security exploit saying that they have "been investigating" it.
Satoshi was very clear that Bitcoin’s utility of being a medium of exchange is what gives it value. By being valuable through utility, is what makes Bitcoin also be a store of value.
@Bitcoin on Twitter: I'm back, @jack
Bitcoin protocol upgrade (hard fork) mega thread
Reddit admin says they are bringing back the Bitcoin payment option after migrating to Coinbase Commerce (presumably will also include Bitcoin Cash payment option too)
Chandler Guo on Twitter: "i jump to #BitcoinUnlimted today!"
Roger Ver on Twitter: "Carl Mark Force and other govt agents infiltrated the Silk Road by getting admin status all the way back in 2012. Perhaps the censorship imposing mods Bashco and Theymos on /r/Bitcoin are just government agents intentionally delaying crypto currency adoption."
Edward Snowden on Twitter: "Censorship is never the answer"

Vinny Lingham on Twitter: 'We spent years building a payment network for Bitcoin [Core] and it’s being dismantled. Sad, actually.' Vinny laments on how Bitcoin Core (BTC) has destroyed itself from the inside out.
Coinbase on Twitter: (1/3) Coinbase has re-enabled sends/receives of BCH on Coinbase Pro, Prime, http://Coinbase.com and the iOS and Android apps. We expect to enable full BCH trading and functionality, including buys/sells on http://Coinbase.com , in the next 2 days.
I was one of the first people to buy @aantonop’s Mastering Bitcoin books back in the day (that he personally signed). I’m a long time fan of his but super disappointed that of all people he is now pushing his own propaganda and self-censorship.
/r/Bitcoin is brigading TrustPilot to give Bitcoin.com bad ratings (it's full of fake reviews).
Chandler Guo's Mining Pool to Support Bitcoin Unlimited
It’s mind boggling to hear people say Bitcoin blocks should be so small that you can run full nodes on tiny hard drives to self-validate txs but in the same vein think $100 tx fees are okay. I highly doubt these same people are even validating their own txs w/such high fees.
Kim Dotcom on Twitter: "Every #Megaupload file transfer will be linked to a tiny #Bitcoin micro transaction. Get ready for Bitcache."
Edward Snowden: The answer to fake news is not censorship, but critical thinking

I’ve never encountered such a hateful/jealous group like BTC maximalists. They will do anything to disparage others or any project that competes w/ BTC. They are misogynistic, ridicule people who help others, they troll constantly & have THE most toxic community in all of crypto.
Bitcoin.com under DDoS attack today (easily mitigated). Someone doesn’t want Bitcoin Cash to succeed. I wonder who? 🤔
CobraBitcoin: "Lightning is cool, but nobody should be recommending it to actual merchants for at least the next few years. Merchants like Steam already got hurt by adopting Bitcoin and regretting it later. Lightning needs time to mature and prove itself. Mad hype to rush adoption will harm it."
If people are wondering why there are not more companies supporting big blocks, the recent smear campaign shows why (Post by Thomas Zander on Bitcoin Forum)
Core supporter BitUsher let's it slip on what every Bitcoin Cash supporter says almost daily: Lightning Network is unproven and untested and nobody knows how it will work. Makes total sense to test it out on a multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency. /s

Rapper 50 Cent Accepts Bitcoin For New Album 'Animal Ambition'

Cobra: "It’s easy to understand why Bitcoin Cash supporters say their coin is the “original vision”, because it probably *is* closer to the original vision. Bitcoin was obviously meant to be used for commerce and not just as a store of value [...]"

I'm Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com and world's first investor in Bitcoin startups. AMA
The pro Bitcoin Cash video from CNBC made it to the very front page of Yahoo.com!
I (Roger Ver) will be doing an AMA on Monday Dec 18th starting at 10AM EST on /r/BTC because /r/Bitcoin is completely censored.
Reminder: Blockstream and Core got 100% of everything they asked for.
I'm giving away $100 each of BCH and BTC on live TV tomorrow by displaying the private key. Guess why?

To the Censorship loving tyrants in /r/Bitcoin, don't Say Bitcoin.com didn't warn you! "In the unlikely event that the 2MB block size increase portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively."
Sign the Petition for Clemency for Ross Ulbricht, Serving Double Life for a Website

I just bet 1,000 BTC (~$4M USD) that Segwit 2X coin will have more value than Segwit 1x coin.
If you think consumers are going to throw away $100’s (and soon $1000’s) on transaction fees to open up a payment channel on the Lightning network, you are delusional.
PSA: If you get an email from me (Roger Ver) asking to borrow BTC, you can be 100% sure it as a scam. If they ask to borrow BCH, it is more plausible, but still a scam.
Ross Ulbricht turns 34 on March 27. It's his fifth birthday spent in a cage.
How to destroy Bitcoin
BTC Supporters........
Here is someone sending Andreas Antonopoulos a tip of $1.50.They ended up paying $13.46 in transaction fees.
If the 2X portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively.
Shapeshift is coming soon to the Bitcoin.com Wallet!

TokenStars has dropped BTC as a payment, and added BCH!
A picture is worth a thousand words
Zimbabwe gets its first Bitcoin ATM
Bitcoin Cash is spreading in Tokyo! (Because it actually works)
Fun Fact: Bitcoin.com is adding over 10,000 new users per day and all of them are getting Bitcoin Cash wallets.
Bitcoin.com is now a top 4,000 website in the world!
Message to Theymos
In 2013 everyone knew that Bitcoin could scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second on chain.
When you invite someone to do a video interview, and then refuse to release the video, that makes you a fraud Dennis.
I think many of you were not around back in 2011 when I started paying for this national radio advertisement on more than 100 radio stations across the country. According to the Core trolls I'm someone who wants to destroy Bitcoin.
"So no worries, Ethereum's long term value is still ~0." -Greg Maxwell, CTO of Blockstream and opponent of allowing Bitcoin to scale as Satoshi had planned.
If you are confused between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core in the Bitcoin.com wallet, you are a liar or mentally handicapped.
Bitcoin.com (promoting BCH) is now a top 1,000 website in the USA!
High Bitcoin Tx Fee Problem Solved! (Thanks Blockstream!)
1,000,000 Bitcoin Cash wallets have now been created thanks to Bitcoin.com
Censored! See the video that Core supporters had banned from Youtube because they don't want you to see it!
Bitcoin.com is currently being DDOSed. (When civilized people don't like a website, they just don't visit it)
The double standard at /r/Bitcoin on full display:
One of the top posts for the entire year of 2015 on /r/Bitcoin. (It was then censored)
"Bitcoin was originally peer to peer electronic cash, not this settlement layer that Core is pushing."
/r/BTC has surpassed 50K subscribers! (Because /r/Bitcoin is censored)
A blast from the past:
Bitcoin.com is now a top 2,000 website in the world! (Bitcoin Cash is spreading!)
No need to debate the issues when you have censorship and troll armies on your side.
As the Bitcoin.com wallet approaches 1M installs, yesterday was the first time in its history that people used it to make more BCH transactions than BTC.
If all the 32MB blocks were permanently 100% full, this $400 hard drive could store the blockchain for the next 7 years.
"I wonder if Starbucks is aware of the fact that there was quite literally a civil war over whether coffee should be on the blockchain, and that they're on the chain that doesn't want coffee."
Just a reminder, and some proof that /r/Bitcoin is completely censored

The source of sock puppets
To the Twitter liars like Whale Panda and DarkPill claiming tonight's Tokyo event wasn't related to BCH, the reception desk was covered with BCH signs, and every single person who attended was given a BCH sticker.
HOW WRONG WERE THEY?: Tone Vays claims vehemently that Segwit will instantly fix all scaling problems. Meanwhile fees are higher than ever.
The people behind Bitcoin Cash are the ones who created Bitcoin's network effect in the first place.
r/Bitcoin subscribers are now calling for people to report Bitcoin.com to the Internet Crime Complaint Center of the FBI. It's sad that BTC supporters all seem to be statists who yell about hodling their muh store of value all day.

If the conflict within Bitcoin is getting you down...
"A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds." - Ted Nelson
G. Andresen: "Sorry, I’m not doing public interviews any more (risks outweigh benefits, sadly)." For those that dont know, Gavin was declared lead developer of Bitcoin by Satoshi himself back in 2010. Due to those trying to kill P2P Cash, they have succeeded in silencing his voice!
EXPELLED: Bitcoin.org DELETES Coinbase, BitPay & Blockchain from their resources pages.
Andreas: "Gavin is right. The time to increase the block size limit is before transaction processing shows congestion problems. Discuss now, do soon" May 5, 2015!
Ryan X. Charles (CEO Yours.org) "We are going to make it possible for you to use one-touch micro-payments anywhere on the internet!"
Bitcoin.com, ViaBTC join ‘Miner’s Choice’ initiative for Bitcoin Cash miners. ...a move that will eliminate the current dust limit and begin processing a number of zero-free transactions in every Bitcoin BCH block.
A little demo of sending BCH (via CoinText) from one phone to a Bitcoin.com wallet on another phone and then to a Yours.org account... all within seconds! The power/speed of Peer-to-Peer Elect Cash!
Andreas doubles down: "Yes, I changed my opinion, because I saw new facts." Tweeted just now... He does not elaborate on what these NEW facts are...
EXPELLED: Daniel Krawisz, Co-Founder of Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. Daniel discusses how "The SNI community gradually became intolerable. Eventually I came to feel like I had no say in the organization anymore." But is being revived with NSI
The secret of freedom lies in educating people, whereas the secret of tyranny is in keeping them ignorant. -M. Robespierre
"We can do 0-conf in less than 500ms."
PurseIO v4.0 supporting BCH release about to take-off!
Usability: "We don't need a guide when using credit cards or cash. The fact any guide at all is needed to be created for p2p commerce is a problem we shouldn't have. No barriers to entry are the goal. "
BitAsiaEX Founder and CEO says: "SM [selfish mining] is something built on air, and that's why BitAsiaEX is the first exchange to enable 0-conf for BCH (Sorry, no 0_conf for SegWit coin)
"The Truth HURTS! "Ms Stark has called the study “bullshit.” "This leads us to believe that Ms Stark has not actually read our article."
BitcoinRewards.com: "When we launched... on the 1st of December 17, we also had $BTC. We give an aggressive amount of commission back to the end user, hence we dropped BTC due to high fees and its hostility toward business."
Memo "competitor" charges $9 to "archive any tweet to the Bitcoin blockchain". Of course they using the crippled coin....
G. Andresen: "Events of the last 3yrs make me certain that there will be a healthy fee mkt even if blocks aren't full. And people/businesses will switch to a lower-cost chain." Dec 16, 2017 Gavin was lead Bitcoin developer in the early years... 2010-2014
For a coreon to spam/troll Memo/BlockPress they MUST use BCH! For many, this would be the FIRST tx they have made with P2P Cash! Yes a tiny amount, but that is not conundrum. The fact that they have to use BCH, and experience how easy/quick/cheap it is could easily create a Nomad Moment!
EXPELLED: "Yep this is why I quit Purse and will not recommend it anymore..." @RussellRukin response to PurseIO article on "Bitcoin Cash: Everything you need to know!"
Ryan X Charles Interviews Jaqi Lenee on why PurseIO adopted Bitcoin Cash
nChain said (Dec 2017): "nChain is pleased to see that the Developer and Testing Groups will work towards incorporating the following features: 4:Transaction Order in Blocks: Remove the current restriction on transaction order in blocks, and replace it with a canonical order by transaction ID."
BTC.TOP/Jiang Zhuoer: "BTC.TOP’s hashrate will pledge support to the party who is willing to invest more hashrate and capital, quickly resolve the war and let BCH chain resume its operation the soonest."
BitPay wallet ties fees together for BTC/BCH and setting BCH fee to 1-sat/byte is not possible! Like many other wallets (NOT the Bitcoin.com wallet), they have been infected by the crippled coin problems and thus ave. BCH fees are not near as low as they should be (well under 1/cent USD)
"The world needs Bitcoin Cash. It will bring economic freedom to millions of people around the world and fundamentally change the way the world works. " Compilation of Rogers presentation in Thailand-less than 3-min long
Wallets need to be updated to allow lower than 1-Sat/byte fee settings so users can take advantage of miners that accept lower and even ZERO fees like the new CG/nChain Miners Choice Initiative!
Amaury Sechet (BitcoinABC): "It's done when everyone is using it!... This is the biggest problem..." Vin Armani (creator of CoinText) interviewed Amaury earlier today
5-yrs ago today (2013): "They are convinced that something must be wrong with Bitcoin, but when they attempt to articulate it, they arrive at conclusions which are either subjective or fallacious."
"CG/nChain announce Miner’s Choice initiative for BCH miners to lower minimums for fees and tx values. More choices for miners creates more options for users, and will spark faster adoption of Bitcoin Cash. Remove the current min. dust limit of 546 Satoshi. Accept some free tx's in ea block."
Bitcoin and the Power Grid by Paul Rosenberg "Cryptocurrencies don’t finance war. If you want to throw a war in a crypto-based economy, you’ll have to convince people to pay for it. Good luck."
Josh Ellithorpe from Coinbase (at Satoshi's Vision Conference) responding to question: How to market 0-Conf.: "I just think they are a instant transaction. It feels like it confirms instantly!"
US CFTC: "...these currencies are not going away and they will proliferate to every economy and every part of the planet." "We are witnessing a modern miracle"
"Escaping the Global Banking Cartel" The Andreas Antonopoulos that we remember... at the top of his game... "Bitcoin matters as an exit when voice is no longer an option."
If one is unsure about the HARM that BTC/Blockstream has done to Bitcoin adoption (and thereby its value), one only has to answer a few questions. Through purposeful and specific actions, BTC/Blockstream (and some "supporters") have:
HandCash app/wallet is Fabulous! Have you tried it yet?

Peer-to-Peer Cash CAN dramatically reduce the occurrence of wars & genocide by diminishing the ability of *political entities* to just print money since its use/demand will be radically reduced!
PARADOXICAL?: "this will be released open source on BitcoinSV only"
"Bitcoin is an infinite game. You cannot win an infinite game. Because in order for a winner to be declared a game must end. The point of an infinite game is to continue playing. You can only do that if others continue to want to play the game as well"
Regarding raising the block size: Andreas Antonopoulos says: "Thats never been off the road-map. Its just simply been a matter of deciding what to do first."
Blockstream patent: "Weaknesses in the implem. of Bitcoin identified: Inability to customize trade-offs between scale-ability and decentralization: for ex., a larger blk size would allow the ntwk to support a hghr tx rate, at the cost of placing more work on validators-centralization risk."

/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says "Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain" and Bitcoin Core is not. If you have to censor to get people to believe you, then you have lost.
Free_Ross on Twitter: "ALL charges of murder-for-hire vs. Ross are now dropped. After almost 5 years, gov't has moved to dismiss final MD indictment based on evidence from corrupt agent now in prison."
Someone hacked the account /u/todu which was a mod here to point users to /r/bitcoin
Former /r/cryptocurrency mod: "I used to be a mod of r/cryptocurrency until they kicked me out. Now, that sub, is controlled all by mods with accounts less than 7 months old!"

Twitter continues to go downhill - flags @Bitcoin account as ‘temporarily restricted due to unusual activity’
There is a huge edit war on Wikipedia where trolls like the user "Jtbobwaysf" are trying very hard to inject the word "bcash" into Bitcoin Cash pages and reverting/editing other pages that speak factually poorly on topics such as Lightning Network, Segwit, etc.
What /r/bitcoin mods desperately don't want you to see!
/r/btc is trending on reddit today, congrats everyone!
Bitcoin Cash is upgrading on May 15 to 32MB max block limit
Cofounder and CEO of Yours, Ryan X. Charles on Twitter: "I have to come out of the closet about something. I read r/btc, not r/bitcoin. Would rather have low quality than censorship."
Roger Ver on Twitter: "/r/Bitcoin is completely censored and has been for nearly 3 years now. I’ll donate $250K USD to the charity of Reddit’s choice if they simply appoint mods that allow people to actually discuss Bitcoin on /r/Bitcoin"
Please read our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
/r/DarkNetMarkets shut down by Reddit
Neil deGrasse Tyson: “If pundits tells you something is true, and you don’t have the critical thinking skills to evaluate their statements, then you are putty in their hands, as they shape your world view to their will.”
A little holiday humor 🎄🎅
Nicholas Merten on Twitter: “It’s really sad to see people accusing me of getting paid or “selling my soul” in crypto by simply taking a photo with Roger Ver. I don’t mean to insult anyone or start conflict, but the sheer disconnect and tribalism of some who’ve joined crypto post-2017 is surreal.”
Just a heads up on what is going on in this sub - please be aware of what is happening. There is a coordinated effort by a specific group to undermine and destroy everything that we support because they are about to lose power come mid-November.
Frances Coppola on Twitter: “Congratulations, Blockstream, you have just reinvented the interbank lending market.”
False Flags, Vote Manipulation, and Trolls

Twitter Cancels @Bitcoin Account as its CEO Invests in Competing Lightning Network. Is a conflict of interest at play? | Finance Magnates News Article
The @Bitcoin account has been suspended (again) by @TwitterSupport only because Core trolls constantly submit fake reports about it. @Jack why do you guys keep letting this happen? Instead of suspending all the fake scammer accounts you suspend the real ones. WTF.
Bitcoin Cash Mega Thread
Dear extortionist: /r/btc will not be blackmailed by you
Kim Dotcom on Twitter: “Must read: The Bitcoin Cash philosophy by @Falkvinge. [...] Our dream. It’s happening 😎”
Friendly reminder: if you haven't yet, watch this video which shows reddit is gamed and manipulated by professional shills paid by companies with huge million dollar budgets. It is up to our community to defend itself against these bad actors.

Once again Core supporters threaten with lawsuits and government intervention to try to get their way. This is just pathetic and not the foundations of what Bitcoin was built on. These are not bitcoiners.

Gavin's new commentary on Wright situation in email with Dan Kaminsky
Coinbase update: We have observed consensus in the community that the BCH ABC chain will retain the designation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Coinbase will also adopt this designation for BCH.
How Craig Wright is attempting to dishonestly take over the Bitcoin network
The whole point of Bitcoin is to usurp govts & banks and empower people to give them financial freedom. You can’t do that with a tiny network that fights against mass adoption. The smaller the network the easier it’s captured. Bitcoin Cash is the future that I’m fighting for now.
Ryan X. Charles on Twitter: The censorship of /r/bitcoin has had a real, negative effect. A lot of beginners are confused and mislead about the issues.
What /r/Bitcoin mods desperately don't want you to see (again, and again)

Governor Jesse Ventura wrote on Twitter: "Thank you @rogerkver for explaining #bitcoin to me."

Bitcoin Cash Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Reddit admins finally chime in on user password security exploit saying that they have "been investigating" it.
Satoshi was very clear that Bitcoin’s utility of being a medium of exchange is what gives it value. By being valuable through utility, is what makes Bitcoin also be a store of value.
@Bitcoin on Twitter: I'm back, @jack
Bitcoin protocol upgrade (hard fork) mega thread
Reddit admin says they are bringing back the Bitcoin payment option after migrating to Coinbase Commerce (presumably will also include Bitcoin Cash payment option too)
Chandler Guo on Twitter: "i jump to #BitcoinUnlimted today!"
Roger Ver on Twitter: "Carl Mark Force and other govt agents infiltrated the Silk Road by getting admin status all the way back in 2012. Perhaps the censorship imposing mods Bashco and Theymos on /r/Bitcoin are just government agents intentionally delaying crypto currency adoption."
Edward Snowden on Twitter: "Censorship is never the answer"

Coinbase on Twitter: (1/3) Coinbase has re-enabled sends/receives of BCH on Coinbase Pro, Prime, http://Coinbase.com and the iOS and Android apps. We expect to enable full BCH trading and functionality, including buys/sells on http://Coinbase.com , in the next 2 days.
I was one of the first people to buy @aantonop’s Mastering Bitcoin books back in the day (that he personally signed). I’m a long time fan of his but super disappointed that of all people he is now pushing his own propaganda and self-censorship.
/r/Bitcoin is brigading TrustPilot to give Bitcoin.com bad ratings (it's full of fake reviews).
Chandler Guo's Mining Pool to Support Bitcoin Unlimited
It’s mind boggling to hear people say Bitcoin blocks should be so small that you can run full nodes on tiny hard drives to self-validate txs but in the same vein think $100 tx fees are okay. I highly doubt these same people are even validating their own txs w/such high fees.
Kim Dotcom on Twitter: "Every #Megaupload file transfer will be linked to a tiny #Bitcoin micro transaction. Get ready for Bitcache."
Edward Snowden: The answer to fake news is not censorship, but critical thinking

A diff of the Exchange Hardfork Statement copy and the signed copy showing removed text that was taken out/changed
I’ve never encountered such a hateful/jealous group like BTC maximalists. They will do anything to disparage others or any project that competes w/ BTC. They are misogynistic, ridicule people who help others, they troll constantly & have THE most toxic community in all of crypto.
Bitcoin.com under DDoS attack today (easily mitigated). Someone doesn’t want Bitcoin Cash to succeed. I wonder who? 🤔
CobraBitcoin: "Lightning is cool, but nobody should be recommending it to actual merchants for at least the next few years. Merchants like Steam already got hurt by adopting Bitcoin and regretting it later. Lightning needs time to mature and prove itself. Mad hype to rush adoption will harm it."
If people are wondering why there are not more companies supporting big blocks, the recent smear campaign shows why (Post by Thomas Zander on Bitcoin Forum)
Core supporter BitUsher let's it slip on what every Bitcoin Cash supporter says almost daily: Lightning Network is unproven and untested and nobody knows how it will work. Makes total sense to test it out on a multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency. /s
~632 users here now on /r/btc
/r/bitcoin has now turned on Bitcoin.org, trying to destroy Cobra Bitcoin's rep - typical Core propaganda now being used against one of their own
Bullish: ShapeShift Most Popular Trade in the last 24 hours (BTC to BCH)

Blockchain CEO Peter Smith on Twitter: "We've dedicated our lives to building bitcoin products, introduced millions to bitcoin, evangelized, long before it was cool. Enemies?" (in response to Adam Back)
A normal day for /r/Bitcoin
Coinbase is re-branding to the Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX)
Did you know you can buy Bitcoin Cash now on Bitcoin.com?
This is a good time to focus on the fundamentals and remember why we are all here. This video by Coinbase does a great job of highlighting that.
Reminder: Cobra-Bitcoin assisted and supported Theymos with agenda driven moderation that was designed to stop Bitcoin from functioning as a cash system.

Banks Don't Want Ripple's $80 Billion of Digital Money

V. Buterin in response to his "anti Core" Tweet: "I'd like to take this opportunity to challenge Bitcoin Cash a little as well. "
Why onchain scaling? Because whether the LN or another 2nd layer scaling can work, we'll have to scale onchain anyway, so the most sensible thing is to make the 1st layer as robust as possible regardless
Would it be against this subreddit's policies to make a mega-list on all the "shitcoins", coins that have no utility, no purpose and just a funding method for a startup, and have that list stickied or put on our sidebar?

Andreas Antonopoulos makes a point that cryprocurriencies should fork-out if they happen to get taken over by corporations and made prone to regulations
First Core was: "they're spamming our network!" Now Core is like: "they're spamming their network!"
The reason why BTC supporters get so emotional in the debate is because they can't rationally argue their fork is the real bitcoin when technically speaking it's transforming BTC into an altcoin which shares only the ledger with the original bitcoin.

It's no coincidence the AXA propaganda focuses so much on stirring hate against Chinese miners - they're outside the reach of the regulator the American banks can lobby, which is precisely what gives Bitcoin (BCH) censorship resistance.

0-conf together with SPV is the secret power which makes the original Bitcoin model so revolutionary. The BCore model which requires sidechains and people running their own full "verifying" nodes... on their toasters completely misses the genius of the old model.
Can you imagine what BTC would have been today had all the effort which went into the LN was put in improving the base layer?
Banks Don't Want Ripple's $80 Billion of Digital Money
Bitcoin and the Power Grid by Paul Rosenberg "Cryptocurrencies don’t finance war. If you want to throw a war in a crypto-based economy, you’ll have to convince people to pay for it. Good luck."
"Increasing the blocksize leads to centralization" is one of the most easy to disprove arguments against scaling onchain
Butter successfully convinced r/Bitcoin they made the right choice buying at $18500. I always take my gambling advice from users who registered 2 days ago.
One of the most ignorant - even anti-crypto - argument I hear around is that BCH is a currency controlled by Chinese miners.

Next Bitcoin Core release (and subsequently Litecoin Core) will re-enable accounts in Core, make it easier to airgap LN nodes for security, and add coinselection.
I took a look at how successful the PoW change was by comparing the hashrate distributions pre- and post- fork as well as the suspicious lack of github activity of the two forked Monero coins that are being traded.
Over the past 3 months, Litecoin's median transaction value has surpassed Bitcoin's although it is only 2% of its value.

@SatoshiLite: CNBC just called and wanted to talk to me on Squawk Box next Monday. I told them no because I was too busy. - Who am I kidding here?! Talking 🐔 on Squawk. How fitting! Sign me up! 😂
@SatoshiLite: You can now buy Steam vouchers with LTC! Thanks @bitrefill for supporting Litecoin!
@MLPFrank: The new Litecoin design overhaul is coming along great. A real emphasis on decluttering, simplifying and focusing on what really matters to users of all levels is key! - Here's to 2018.
@SatoshiLite: The Litecoin team has been hard at work working with companies to support Litecoin. Nothing to announce yet, but here's what's in the works: - Merchant processor Popular online wallet Goods trading platform One huge unexpected surprise. 😀 - 2018 will be a good year for Litecoin!
@SatoshiLite: I will let you guys in on my little secret. The reason why I post so much about Bitcoin is to get Bitcoin maximalists to follow me. Then I slowly chip away at their Highlander beliefs one tweet at a time. Before long, they will have bought some LTC and brainwashed. It works. 😜

@Satoshilite: For the next release of Litecoin reference client, we will reduce the relay fees from 0.001 LTC/kb ($0.30/kb) to 0.00001 LTC ($0.003/kb). We hope to have that out next week. Once people are using the new relay fees, we will reduce the actual min fee to 0.0001 LTC/kb ($0.03/kb).
@SatoshiLite: I'm glad to see that the market is not overacting to this news. - You can't compare me to a CEO selling all his shares. I'm the creator. Litecoin is like my kid. I'm more invested in it than someone holding 1MM LTC. For me, it was never about the money or I would have pre-mined!😀

@SatoshiLite: Like I've said, I don't control when companies release news. Asking me daily won't make it happen faster. And the news might not even move the price. - So, instead of asking me to increase the LTC price with announcements, ask yourself what you can do to help Litecoin adoption!
@SatoshiLite: I ❤️ days like today! Not because the LTC price is up, but because I won't need to read any tweets hating on Litecoin and me. 😂 - But inevitably, there will be days when price is down and everyone and their mom will be blaming it on me. Such is the life of a coin creator. 😀

@TheRealXinxi: @SatoshiLite sold his LTC because he wants to show that he works for Litecoin not to pump it but for the good of the community. I’ve been hodling since 2013 and will keep doing so for quite long time because of my confidence in the team and the community. Don’t misunderstand

@SatoshiLite: Please stop asking me to announce something to help the price. Didn't I say 2018? Also, up to the respective companies to announce Litecoin support, not me. Just like how @Bitso announced LTC trading today. - About rumors, I am not aware of any Amazon or Facebook partnerships.

@SatoshiLite: It's strange to see people claiming that Bitcoin and Litecoin are dead because the price is so low at $8000 and $140 respectively. A year ago, the price was around $1800 and $30. Back then, people would have killed for today's prices! 🤔

The MarchAgainstTrump subreddit is suddenly anti-war, so here's a reminder to everyone here: The Libertarian Party is the *only* political party that has *always* been anti-war since the foundation of the party. If you ever see anyone who supported Hillary or Obama or Trump, remind them of this.
