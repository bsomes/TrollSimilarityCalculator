",METHODOLOGY,"The figures profiled here include money from two sources: These contributors were
  either the sponsors of a PAC that gave to the politician, or they were listed as an individual
  donor's employer. Donors who give more than $200 to any
  federal candidate, PAC or party committee must list their occupation and
  employer. Based on that information, the donor is given an economic code. These totals are conservative,
  as not all of the individual contributions have yet
  been classified by the Center.","In cases where two or more people from the same family contributed, the income-earner's
  occupation/employer is assigned to all non-wage earning family members. If, for instance, Henry Jones
  lists his employer as First National Bank, his wife Matilda lists ""Homemaker"" and 12-year old Tammy
  shows up as ""Student,"" the Center would identify all their contributions as being related to the
  ""First National Bank"" since that's the source of the family's income.","Although individual contributions are generally categorized based on the donor's
  occupation/employer, in some cases individuals may be classified instead as ideological donors.
  A contribution to a candidate may be given an ideological code, rather than an economic code, if
  the contributor gives to an ideological political action committee AND the candidate has received
  money from PACs representing that same ideological interest.","
              NOTE: All the numbers on this page are for the 2009 - 2010 House 
              election cycle and based on Federal Election Commission data available 
              electronically on February 04, 2013.
            "," (""Help! The numbers don't add up..."")","Sometimes it's hard to make apple-to-apple comparisons across some of the pages in a candidate's
  profile. Here's why:","Summary numbers - specifically ""Total Raised and Spent"" and ""PAC/Individual Split"" - are
  based on summary reports filed by the candidates with the Federal Election Commission. All other numbers in
  these profiles (""Quality of Disclosure,"" ""Geography"" and ""Special Interests"") are derived from detailed FEC
  reports that itemize all contributions of $200 or more.","There is also a time lag in posting the information. While summary numbers are reported almost
  immediately by the FEC -- and listed quickly on OpenSecrets -- processing and analyzing the detailed records
  takes much longer. For that reason, summary numbers are usually higher (and more current) than the numbers based
  on detailed records.","The figures in these profiles are taken from databases uploaded by the FEC to the internet on
  the first day of every month. Those databases are only as current as the FEC has been able to compile by that
  date (see the note above about lag times for data entry).","The Center updates figures for ""Total Raised and Spent"" and for ""PAC/Individual Split"" a few
  days after the first of the month. The remaining figures - based on detailed contribution data - is updated
  by the Center after the 20th of every month. This gives us time to analyze the contributions and categorize
  them by industry and interest group.","

"We must pursue policies to transform this country into a nation that affirms the value of its people of color. That starts with addressing the five central types of violence waged against black, brown and indigenous Americans: physical, political, legal, economic and environmental.","Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Jessica Hernandez, Tamir Rice, Jonathan Ferrell, Oscar Grant, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, Samuel DuBose and Anastacio Hernandez-Rojas. We know their names. Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody. The chants are growing louder. People are angry and they have a right to be angry. We should not fool ourselves into thinking that this violence only affects those whose names have appeared on TV or in the newspaper. African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police. African-American and Latinos comprise well over half of all prisoners, even though African-Americans and Latinos make up approximately one quarter of the total US population.","We are far from eradicating racism in this country. Today in America, if you are black, you can be killed for getting a pack of Skittles during a basketball game. Or murdered in your church while you are praying. This violence fills us with outrage, disgust and a deep, deep sadness. These hateful acts of violence amount to acts of terror. They are perpetrated by extremists who want to intimidate and terrorize black, brown and indigenous people in this country.",It is an outrage that in these early years of the 21st century we are seeing intolerable acts of violence being perpetrated by police and racist acts of terrorism by white supremacists.,"A growing number of communities do not trust the police. Law enforcement officers have become disconnected from the communities they are sworn to protect. Violence and brutality of any kind, particularly at the hands of the police meant to protect and serve our communities, is unacceptable and must not be tolerated. We need a societal transformation to make it clear that black lives matter and racism will not be accepted in a civilized country.","In the shameful days of open segregation, literacy laws and poll taxes were used to suppress minority voting. Today, through other laws and actions — such as requiring voters to show photo ID, discriminatory drawing of Congressional districts, restricting same-day registration and early voting and aggressively purging voter rolls — states are taking steps which have a similar effect.","The patterns are unmistakable. 11 percent of eligible voters do not have a photo ID—and they are disproportionately black and Latino. In 2012, African-Americans waited twice as long to vote as whites. Some voters in minority precincts waited upwards of six or seven hours to cast a ballot. Meanwhile, thirteen percent of African-American men have lost the right to vote due to felony convictions.","Yet in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the seminal Voting Rights Act, even while saying “voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.”",This should offend the conscience of every American.,The fight for minority voting rights is a fight for justice. It is inseparable from the struggle for democracy itself.,"Millions of lives have been destroyed because people are in jail for nonviolent crimes. For decades, we have been engaged in a failed “War on Drugs” with racially-biased mandatory minimums that punish people of color unfairly.
It is an obscenity that we stigmatize so many young Americans with a criminal record for smoking marijuana, but not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy. This must change.","If current trends continue, one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. Blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites and a report by the Department of Justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop, compared to white motorists. Together, African-Americans and Latinos comprised 57 percent of all prisoners in 2014, even though African-Americans and Latinos make up approximately one quarter of the US population. These outcomes are not reflective of increased crime by communities of color, but rather a disparity in enforcement and reporting mechanisms. African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police. This is an unspeakable tragedy.",It is morally repugnant that we have privatized prisons all over America. Corporations should not be allowed to make a profit by building more jails and keeping more Americans behind bars. We have got to end the private for-profit prison racket in America. Sen. Sanders has introduced legislation that will end the private prison industry.,"The measure of success for law enforcement should not be how many people get locked up. We need to invest in drug courts as well as medical and mental health interventions for people with substance abuse problems, so that people struggling with addiction do not end up in prison, they end up in treatment.","For people who have committed crimes that have landed them in jail, there needs to be a path back from prison. The federal system of parole needs to be reinstated. We need real education and real skills training for the incarcerated.",We must end the over-incarceration of nonviolent young Americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society. It is an international embarrassment that we have more people locked up in jail than any other country on earth – more than even the Communist totalitarian state of China. That has got to end.,"We must address the lingering unjust stereotypes that lead to the labeling of black youths as “thugs” and “super predators.” We know the truth that, like every community in this country, the vast majority of people of color are trying to work hard, play by the rules and raise their children. It’s time to stop demonizing minority communities.","In many cities all over our country, the incentives for policing are upside down. Departments are bringing in substantial sums of revenue by seizing the personal property of people who are suspected of criminal involvement. So-called civil asset forfeiture laws allow police to take property from people even before they are charged with a crime, much less convicted of one. Even worse, the system works in a way that makes it very difficult and expensive for an innocent person to get his or her property back. We must end programs that actually reward officials for seizing assets without a criminal conviction or other lawful mandate. Departments and officers should not profit off of such seizures.","Local governments that rely on tickets and fines to pay bills can become dependent on implicit quotas for law enforcement. When policing is a source of revenue tied to the financial sustainability of agencies, officers are pressured to meet internal goals which can lead to unnecessary or unlawful traffic stops and citations which disproportionately affect people of color. Implicit quota systems promote racial stereotyping and breed distrust between officers and communities of color.","Furthermore, we must ensure police departments are not abusing avenues of due process to shield bad actors from accountability. Local governments and police management must show zero tolerance for abuses of police power at all levels. All employees of any kind deserve due process protections, but it must be clear that departments will vigorously investigate and, if necessary, prosecute every allegation of wrongdoing to the fullest extent.","Weeks before his death, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke to a union group in New York about what he called “the other America.”","“One America is flowing with the milk of prosperity and the honey of equality,” King said. “That America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies, culture and education for their minds, freedom and human dignity for their spirits … But as we assemble here tonight, I’m sure that each of us is painfully aware of the fact that there is another America and that other America has a daily ugliness about it that transforms the buoyancy of hope into the fatigue of despair.”","The problem was structural, King said: “This country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.”","But what King saw in 1968 — and what we all should recognize today — is that it is necessary to try to address the rampant economic inequality while also taking on the issue of societal racism. We must simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country, while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else — especially those in our minority communities – are becoming poorer.","In addition to the physical violence faced by too many in our country we need to look at the lives of black children and address some difficult facts. Black children, who make up just 18 percent of preschoolers, account for 48 percent of all out-of-school suspensions before kindergarten. We are failing our black children before kindergarten. Black students are expelled at three times the rate of white students. Black girls are suspended at higher rates than all other girls and most boys. According to the Department of Education, African-American students are more likely to suffer harsh punishments — suspensions and arrests — at school. Black students attend schools with higher concentrations of first-year teachers when compared with white students. Black students are more than three times as likely to attend schools where fewer than 60 percent of teachers meet all state certification and licensure requirements.","Communities of color also face the violence of economic deprivation. Let’s be frank: neighborhoods like those in west Baltimore, where Freddie Gray resided, suffer the most. However, the problem of economic immobility isn’t just a problem for young men like Freddie Gray. Despite hard-work and the will to get ahead, millions of Americans spend their entire lives struggling to survive on the economic treadmill.","We live at a time when most older workers have no retirement savings, and millions of working adults have no idea how they will ever retire in dignity. An unforeseen car accident, a medical emergency, or the loss of a job could send their lives into an economic tailspin. And the problems are even more serious when we consider race.","Let us not forget: It was the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street that nearly drove the economy off of a cliff seven years ago. While millions of Americans lost their jobs, homes, life savings and ability to send their kids to college, African-Americans who were steered into expensive subprime mortgages were the hardest hit.","Most black and Latino households have less than $350 in savings. The black unemployment rate has remained roughly twice as high as the white rate over the last 40 years, regardless of education. Real African-American youth unemployment is over 50 percent. African-American women earn 64 cents for every dollar white men make. This is unacceptable. The American people in general want change — they want a better deal. A fairer deal. A new deal. They want an America with laws and policies that truly reward hard work with economic mobility. They want an America that affords all of its citizens with the economic security to take risks and the opportunity to realize their full potential.","People of color disproportionately experience a daily assault on their health and environment. Communities of color are the hardest hit by air and water pollution from industrial factories, power plants, incinerators, chemical waste and lead contamination from old pipes and paint. At the same time, they lack access to parks, gardens and other recreational green space.","Like income inequality, environmental inequality is rapidly growing in the United States.","Black children are five times more likely than white children to have lead poisoning. Indigenous peoples are impacted disproportionately by destructive mining practices and the dumping of hazardous materials on their lands. As demonstrated by Hurricane Katrina, poor communities of color have a harder time escaping, surviving and recovering from climate-related disasters. Taken together, it is clear that people of color experience a disparate exposure to environmental hazards where they “work, live, and play.”","Nationwide, the health of communities is consistently ignored in favor of the profits of corporate polluters. The fact that people of color breathe 46 percent more nitrogen dioxide —which causes respiratory diseases and heart conditions — than whites helps explain why one in six African-American kids has asthma.","The environmental violence being inflicted on people of color who are denied the full rights of citizenship — especially migrant workers and new immigrants — is especially pronounced. Low-income Latino immigrants are more likely to live in areas with high levels of hazardous air pollution than anyone else. In fact, the odds of a Latino immigrant neighborhood being located in an area of high toxic pollution is one in three.","Latinos and African-Americans are more likely to work in hazardous jobs that place them at higher risk for serious occupational diseases, injuries and muscular-skeletal disabilities. The fatality rate among Latino workers is 23 percent higher than the fatal injury rate for all US workers. Often reluctant to complain about poor working conditions for fear of deportation or being fired, Mexican migrant workers are nearly twice as likely as the rest of the immigrant population to die at work. This is unacceptable and must be addressed.","Taken together, these injustices are largely the product of political marginalization and institutional racism. The less political power a community of color possesses, the more likely they are to experience insidious environmental and human health threats. The environmental violence being inflicted on these communities of color is taking a terrible toll, and must be made a national priority. Access to a clean and healthy environment is a fundamental right of citizenship. To deny such rights constitutes an environmental injustice that should never be tolerated.","Friends of Bernie SandersPO Box 391Burlington, VT 05402",Paid for by Friends of Bernie Sanders,© Friends of Bernie Sanders | Privacy Policy

              ",The hidden infrastructure of the 2012 campaign has already been built.,"A handful of so-called Super PACs, enabled to collect unlimited donations by the continued erosion of campaign finance regulations, are expected to rival the official campaign organizations in importance this election. In many cases, these groups are acting essentially as outside arms of the campaigns.","These are America's best-funded political factions, their war chests filled by some of the richest men (and almost all are men) in the country.","More than 80 percent of giving to Super PACs so far has come from just 58 donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics analysis of the latest data, which covers the first half of 2011. The Republican groups have raised $17.6 million and the Democratic groups $7.6 million. Those numbers will balloon, with American Crossroads, the main Republican Super PAC, aiming to raise $240 million.)","The exceptions are two public employee labor unions, whose massive donations match those of some of the largest moguls. The rest are individuals with vast fortunes at their disposal. They constitute two different tribes.","The conservative red tribe is dominated by businessmen who have built or inherited fortunes. They also include Wall Street investors, oil and gas men, construction magnates, and retail executives. Mormons are well represented.",The liberal blue tribe is dominated by men from Hollywood and media entrepreneurs -- often Jewish -- and the leaders of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).,"The Super PACs are not paragons of transparency, but what has been disclosed gives a sense of where the money is coming from and the interests of those giving it. Based on the donors and the origins of these groups, we can already discern what messages the Super PACs will generate in the home stretch of the campaign.","What follows is a pocket guide to the big money tribes of American politics, what they will tell you -- and what they won't.","
AMERICAN CROSSROADS
","Staffed by former officials from the Republican National Committee and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and associated with Karl Rove. Many consider it more important than the RNC itself. Certainly American Crossroads and Fox News control the GOP's message in a way the Republican National Committee does not and cannot. It is not unfair to say that during a presidential election year, the Republican Party is more an adjunct to American Crossroads, than vice versa.","
The funders:
","What you'll hear: ""Corrupt liberal elites squandered your hard-earned dollars on the socialist in the White House who appeases Muslims.""","Look for Crossroads to focus relentlessly on economic issues. Recent Web ads by the group hitting Obama for the stimulus package, for proposing new taxes on the wealthy, and imposing too many regulations on business offer a taste of what's to come.","Crossroads' favored form is the attack ad. The group has already bought billboards and radio airtime targeting Sen. Claire McCaskill, who is seen as a vulnerable Dem in 2012, for a scandal involving unpaid taxes on her private plane.","What you won't hear: ""Let's ban abortion."" ""George W. Bush was a good president.""  ""Time to reinstate 'don't ask, don't tell.'""","
RESTORE OUR FUTURE 
","Founded by former aides to Mitt Romney, this group is expected to maintain the minimum legal distance between itself and Romney's official campaign. Romney himself even spoke at a Manhattan fundraiser for the group, though -- apparently for legal reasons -- he left the room before an explicit appeal for money was made, the Times reported.","
The funders:
","Also pitching in $1 million to Restore Our Future is Jeremy Blickenstaff, Lund's son-in-law and an attorney who has worked at Nu Skin. He does not have a history of political giving, but Blickenstaff did do a stint at the Marriage Law Foundation, a Utah-based group that ""provides legal resources to defend and protect marriage between a husband and wife.""","What you'll hear: ""We need a man who has run a business running the White House.""","The group is legally barred from coordinating expenditures -- such as buying ads -- with the Romney campaign, but look for it to echo Romney's message closely. Its bare-bones website, for example, declares that ""It is time that we restore our future by supporting candidates who have worked in the private sector and created jobs, who understand the economy, and who believe in America, American workers, and American values."" That candidate is Mitt Romney, the group made clear in its formation announcement in June:","Our nation is burdened by a struggling economy; our job creators who are tied up with red tape, and a growing federal government is stifling the private sector. President Obama has failed to fix the problems that affect Americans. ... Restore Our Future will support our next president, Mitt Romney.","Restore Our Future appears to have kept its powder dry -- so far. As of its most recent Federal Election Commission filings, which cover the first half of 2011, the group has not bought any ad time or spent money on other substantive political action.","What you won't hear: ""Mitt's healthcare plan is superior to Barack's.""","
PRIORITIES USA ACTION
","A Democratic response to Rove's American Crossroads, this group was founded in April by former White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton and former Rahm Emanuel aide Sean Sweeney. It will essentially function as an outside arm of the Obama reelection campaign.","
The funders:
","What you'll hear: ""The GOP will cut your Medicare to fund tax cuts for the rich.""","It has already run a few ads, including a spot blaming Republicans for opposing economic reforms, giving tax breaks to the wealthy, and favoring a plan to ""essentially end Medicare."" Previewing the themes of Obama's reelection campaign if Mitt Romney is the nominee, the group bought ads in South Carolina -- timed for a visit by Romney -- attacking Romney's support of Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare.","What you won't hear: ""Maintain status quo for Wall Street."" ""Forever war in Afghanistan."" ""Yes, we can ... lead from behind.""","
MAJORITY PAC
","Founded this year by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Majority PAC is devoted to helping Democrats win in contested Senate races. ""The best Senate strategists in the country are coming together for 2012 to make sure Senate races have every tool needed to win,"" Susan McCue, one of the leaders of the effort and a former Reid chief of staff, told Politico. ""We are approaching this as a team led by those who know how to win in the toughest, most competitive races across the country."" Reid himself along with Sen. John Kerry have sent out fundraising solicitations for the group, with Reid's pitch explicitly framing Majority PAC as a means to counter ""the deep pockets and nasty tactics of Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers and their network of corporate-backed special interest groups.""","
The funders:
","What you'll hear: ""Tea Party bullies want to cut your Medicare and Obamacare to pay for tax cuts for Wall Street.""","Noting that 23 Senate Democrats are up for reelection in 2012 -- compared to just 10 Republicans -- Majority PAC says it will run ""a transparent, low-overhead, take-no-prisoners Independent Expenditure campaign, [to] aggressively contest critical open seats, exploit opportunities to take over Republican seats and expand our firewall, and respond to attacks from Rove and his allies on Democratic Senate candidates."" So far the group's website features state-specific ads from an affiliate group seizing on the GOP plan to end Medicare.","What you won't hear: ""America yearns for Harry Reid's Las Vegas gravitas.""","
HOUSE MAJORITY PAC
","Yet another liberal Super PAC with deep ties to Democratic officialdom, it was founded this past spring by Ali Lapp, the former campaign director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, along with a couple of other former DCCC officials. The goal: win a Democratic majority in the House.","
The funders:
","What you'll hear: ""Eric Cantor and Tea Party bullies want to wreck government and Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the rich.""","Like the other Dem Super PACs, the House Majority PAC has seized on Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare. Its website says, ""We're fighting against the recently-passed Republican budget, which provides trillions in new tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, but ends Medicare as we know it by turning it into a voucher program and forcing seniors to find and purchase private health insurance."" The House Majority PAC already ran an ad in New York's special election attacking Republican Bob Turner on Medicare, and another ad against Wisconsin Republican Sean Duffy for his vote in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. The Duffy spot also echoed President Obama's recent focus on private jet owners.","What you won't hear: ""Greenlight Israel's annexation of the West Bank."" "" America yearns for Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco style.""",- - - - - - - - - -,"Of course, the red and the blue tribes are hardly the only players in the political campaign. They have the deep pockets to dominate the airwaves with their advertising. But with the spread of the Internet, the influence of broadcast television is weakening.","There's an invisible tribe too. There are a slew of political nonprofits that will also be running campaign ads in 2012 who, because of their classification in the tax code, do not have to release donor information. So it's worth remembering there will be a lot of anonymous money in the game.",We'll look at them in a future article ., Justin Elliott is a reporter for ProPublica.

",Much of the expected three-way slugfest for the GOP presidential campaign will play out in Iowa: Both Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry promised Sunday to work overtime here for Iowans’ allegiances.,"It remains unclear how much Mitt Romney will campaign in Iowa. He’s been the presumed national front-runner, before a whirlwind political weekend catapulted Bachmann and Perry to the forefront of attention.","Both Perry and Romney need to be careful not to underestimate Bachmann, winner of Saturday’s Iowa straw poll, Republicans here said Sunday. The Minnesota congresswoman became the first native Iowan to take home the straw poll trophy, winning 4,823 votes.",She told The Des Moines Register on Sunday that neither rival intimidates her in the slightest.,"“Not at all,” she said in an interview from Waterloo, where she kicked off her campaign 49 days ago. “I think we have a tremendous advantage after coming out of the straw poll Saturday. … Now we’re going to be doubling our efforts here in Iowa.”","Also Sunday, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty threw in the towel after more than a year of laying groundwork in Iowa.","Perry, governor of Texas, announced his presidential bid Saturday in South Carolina, while straw poll voting was being conducted. He captured 718 write-in votes for sixth place. That beat Romney’s 567 votes even though Romney’s name was on the ballot.","Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, had decided not to compete in the straw poll this time after winning it four years ago, which made his low vote count inevitable, said veteran Republican operative Gentry Collins. An advocacy group, meanwhile, organized the write-in campaign for Perry.","“I would read a lot less into Romney or Perry numbers than into the results among those who played,” said Collins, a 2008 Romney campaign strategist.",Collins added: “It will be interesting to see how the Obama people read Saturday’s result. They are likely to dismiss it because they view Bachmann as unelectable. I hope they make the mistake of underestimating what happened Saturday.”,"Ann Trimble Ray, the Sac County Republican Central Committee chairwoman, said it’s a good thing there are six months left until the Iowa caucuses and 15 months left before the general election. “We need time to meet, measure and research the candidates,” she said.",Romney has had his national vetting and remains standing. Bachmann is well into hers. Perry’s is just starting.,"Frank Donatelli, chairman of GOPAC, a conservative political action committee, and former White House political director for President Ronald Reagan, said Bachmann will need to expand her support beyond core Republicans. Perry’s challenge is to tailor his appeal beyond conservative Texas, where he has run all of his previous campaigns. And Romney must overcome the criticism of his Massachusetts health care plan “and generate some real enthusiasm for his candidacy from base Republicans.”","For the more mild-mannered Republican voter – business people, nonevangelicals, those more concerned about beating Obama than ideology – Romney has the most potential appeal, several Iowa Republicans said.","Bachmann and Perry will likely split the evangelical vote, said Joni Scotter, a Marion Republican. Will Romney just let them duke it out here, continue to play lightly in Iowa and focus on Obama? Or will he campaign more aggressively here to prevent himself from being left in the dust?","“I sincerely hope we see a lot of both of them leading up to the caucus,” said Trimble, referring to Romney and Perry. “Both have said they will be in Iowa, and I believe they will only earn caucus support if they do come ready to engage in retail politics here.”","RECORD: Perry and his campaign staff talk up his record, saying he created a business climate that attracts jobs, has balanced budgets, didn’t raise taxes, enacted tort reform, supports gun rights and helped pass laws requiring IDs to vote and a sonogram before an abortion.","“HOWDY”: Perry, if you hear him on the radio, sounds uncannily similar to George W. Bush. He started off Saturday’s announcement speech in Charleston, S.C., with one word: “Howdy.” Iowans like friendly informality on the campaign trail. (But a possible downside: Do Iowa voters have Texas fatigue?)","FUNDRAISING MUSCLE: Perry hails from a state chock-full of big conservative donors. The New York Times reported this past weekend that Perry is “among the top political fundraisers in the country, with a vast network of wealthy supporters eager to bankroll his presidential ambitions.” He raised $102 million in three gubernatorial campaigns.","SALUTE: Perry was in the U.S. Air Force, “flying C-130s all around the globe,” as he put it in his announcement speech.",IMMIGRATION: Will Perry’s support for amnesty be an Achilles’ heel? He has criticized Arizona’s tough new illegal immigration enforcement law in 2010. He signed a bill in 2001 that made Texas the first to give college tuition breaks for undocumented immigrants in state schools. He called a proposal to build a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border “idiocy” and has said it’s unrealistic to deport people already here illegally.,"CAN HE TAKE CREDIT? Texas’ job growth was connected to rising oil prices, government growth, military spending, lack of a housing bubble, cheap immigrant labor and other factors, the Houston Chronicle has reported. Jobs there grew at about the same rate during Democrat Ann Richards’ four years as governor, the Austin American Statesman noted. Meanwhile, unemployment is higher than 8 percent, and per-pupil education spending is one of the lowest in the country. Texas tied Mississippi for the highest percentage of minimum-wage earners in 2010.","TEXAS’ JOB CREATION: Perry often claims, and his acolytes often repeat, that more than half the jobs created in the United States in the past decade were in Texas. That’s “barely true,” according to Politifact.com, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking service. The Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that Texas gained 907,000 jobs between December 2000 and December 2010, while U.S. job growth was 1.6 million. But that doesn’t take into account jobs created in the 31 states where job losses outnumbered gains in that decade. It also fails to capture all jobs added in states with job gains, Politifact found.","TAPPED FEDERAL MONEY: Perry balanced the Texas budget in 2009 with $12 billion in federal stimulus, a no-no for some Iowa tea party activists.",CAREER POLITICIAN: Perry was elected as a Democrat to the Texas Legislature in 1984 and has been in statewide elected office since. (He switched to the Republican Party in 1989.),"PAPERS ON THE FRIDGE: His college transcript shows he struggled with his grades at Texas A&M University in College Station. He rarely earned above a C and wound up with a D in an economics course, the paperwork shows.",UNBENDING: Bachmann’s energy and her stubbornness about compromise on debt issues hit the sweet spot for tea party disdain for President Barack Obama.,"GIRL FROM WATERLOO: Even though she picked up a Minnesota accent after she moved out of Iowa in sixth grade, it’s not hard to spot the seventh-generation Iowan in her.","THICK OR THIN: Her supporters will stick with her through thick and thin. They have a general distrust of the media (except maybe Fox News), and won’t care about storylines suggesting she’s not White House material. And they’ll help her raise enough money to compete.","NO ABORTIONS, EVER: She’s also a good fit for Iowa social conservatives as a candidate who thinks all abortions are wrong, under any circumstance. She opposes same-sex marriage, too.",CROWDED CORNER: Bachmann and Perry likely will plumb the same conservative depths and Republican voters.,"QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE: In a race to face an incumbent president criticized for his lack of executive experience, Bachmann’s relatively short legislative career in the U.S. House and Minnesota Senate could be a liability.","MAKE-OR-BREAK: The fight for victory in the Iowa caucuses, scheduled for Feb. 6, could be a death match — both Bachmann and Perry need to win Iowa because both will be at a disadvantage in New Hampshire, which is less dominated by social conservatives.","GAFFE WATCH: Bachmann has been criticized for inaccurate or outlandish statements, but has shown greater rhetorical discipline lately.","BEEN HERE, DONE THIS: The 2012 cycle is Romney’s second time through the presidential nomination meat-grinder, following a run that petered out four years ago. That experience gives him a “quasi-incumbent” status in a party that sometimes prefers orderly succession. He knows Iowa, and Iowans know him.
STICKING TO BUSINESS: Romney’s greatest selling point is his business experience and acumen. He boasts a 25-year career in the private sector. At the Iowa State Fair, he dropped one of the most memorable lines of the campaign so far: “Corporations are people, my friend.”
WELL-CAPITALIZED: Romney has long been a skilled and prolific campaign fundraiser. He had an $18 million haul between April and June of this year, easily the largest of any current Republican candidate. Convincing donors is seen as just as important as convincing voters, and a big war chest will be a must for the GOP nominee who faces incumbent Obama in November 2012.
ABLE TO DEFEAT OBAMA?: A CNN poll of registered voters Aug. 5-7 shows Romney is on Obama’s heels, with 49 percent leaning more toward the Democratic president and 48 percent leaning toward Romney if he were the GOP candidate. In an Obama/Perry matchup, it was 51 percent for Obama and 46 percent for Perry. Bachmann trailed Obama by six points, 51 to 45.","A MASSACHUSETTS REPUBLICAN: Before seeking office and early on in his political career, Mitt Romney expressed views on abortion and same-sex marriage that conflict with social-conservative orthodoxy, which vehemently opposes both. Although he has since tracked right on both issues, that early record doesn’t sit well with the conservative voters who make up an active arm of the Iowa Republican caucus electorate.","BABY, YOU’RE A RICH MAN: Romney’s executive experience might play well in these tough economic times, but what about his executive compensation? The former investment firm executive has personal assets exceeding $190 million, and has tapped into those funds in previous campaigns. Tim Pawlenty poked fun at Romney’s wealth at the Republican debate last week.","AN ENTHUSIASM GAP? Bachmann has an electricity that draws followers like a magnet in Iowa and in the tea party nationwide. Perry, too, despite his late entry, is capturing attention and generating excitement from social and fiscal conservatives alike. Many Republicans like Romney, but don’t love him.",You must be logged in to post a comment.,"

","Gender wars: Katy Gallagher accuses Mitch Fifield of mansplainingTHE AUSTRALIANFEBRUARY 11, 2016 11:07AMRick MortonSocial Affairs reporter Senator Katy Gallagher accused Mitch Fifield of 'mansplaining’.The spectre of the gender wars has been invoked in Senate estimates this morning after a line of questioning by new Labor senator Katy Gallagher resulted in a spat between her and government minister Mitch Fifield in which she accused him of “mansplaining”.Senator Gallagher was asking about the status of social security legislation the day after Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister and whether there was any change to the introduction of bills, with Senator Fifield explaining that these were matters for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.The argument went on, with Senator Gallagher rephrasing the question a number of times.“Thanks for the mansplaining,” she said toward the end of the first session of Community Affairs estimates.“Imagine if I said you were womansplaining,” Senator Fifield said, before adding she was being “sexist”.Senator Gallagher said his answers had been “patronising and condescending”.“I thought we were having a good-hearted exchange, I just find it extraordinary that you or any senator at this table would seek to invoke gender in impugning how a senator is responding,” Senator Fifield said.“Let the record show that Senator Gallagher thinks it is appropriate to refer to a senator as mansplaining.“I am appalled, quite frankly. I am not endeavouring here to give a cabinet handbook description of the legislative process. Take a good look at yourself.“If I said to a female senator you are womansplaining, stop being a hypocrite, conduct yourself appropriately for this place. Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor.”Senator Gallagher responded: “I think you need to settle down, really.”“Welcome to federal parliament,” Senator Fifield said.Senator Gallagher, incensed, said: “Oh, where the big people play? I’m not the one having a breakdown.”The session was called to order and the senators moved on to more sedate questions.What is ‘mansplaining’?Urban Dictionary explains:Originally, this term was used to describe boorish men who felt the need to “correct” what a woman said, even on topics that the man didn’t know anything about.However, the term quickly degenerated into a get-out-of-jail-free card used by angry women when a man dares to point out even the most blatant error.Old: That Bob is trying to tell Jill how to raise a horse? She’s raised championship thoroughbreds for decades and he’s never even ridden a horse. What a stupid mansplainer!New: OF COURSE HAMSTERS KNOW HOW TO SPEAK IN RUSSIAN! STOP MANSPLAINING!","

                    Updated 10/21/2011 01:33 PM EDT", ," Gary Johnson emphasized his libertarian and independent appeal in a letter to RNC chairman Reince Priebus asking for intervention with the media in being allowed in to the debates, which he's mostly been left out of; ",Story Continued Below," It is no secret that not all of my views, particularly on some so-called ‘social issues’ are shared by certain elements of the Republican Party – elements who frankly exert inordinate influence within the Party. Many of my supporters who are Independents – and even Democrats – are quick to suggest that the Republican “establishment” doesn’t want my voice heard. I hope that is not the case. To the contrary, as I travel the country, I find a great number of Republicans who not only share my views, but who feel disenfranchised by a vocal minority that has become the face of the Party. ", My electoral success in a heavily Democrat state should serve as proof that my candidacy presents an opportunity to demonstrate that the Republican Party is big enough to allow a slightly different voice to be heard. That will be important next year when it comes time to turn our attention to the ultimate goal: Convincing a majority of Americans that they want a Republican in the White House. ," With the early Republican primaries and caucuses fast approaching, I urge you to exert some leadership and reclaim the nominating process from the national news media who are today pre-ordaining the viability and success of candidates. It is Republican voters who ultimately lose when the process is skewed, and serving the interests of those voters is, in fact, your responsibility, as is the integrity of the nominating process. ", UPDATE: An RNC spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. , But a source said that Priebus had reached out to Johnson about the problem. ," There has been some talk among Libertarians about Johnson, who is taking a tea party fiscal position, running as a third party candidate.

,"MOISES MENDOZA, HOUSTON CHRONICLE",Caption,Close,The elders at Ecclesia Church were expecting something tame from Jackson Potts II for their annual Stations of the Cross art display.,"Instead, the 10-year-old produced a photo of his kid brother being beaten by a police officer. Jackson says it's a modern-day interpretation of Roman soldiers beating Jesus.","It's disturbing and could frighten children, argue church elders, who declined to display it in the church's art gallery alongside the work of other artists depicting the remaining 14 stations (the 15th depicts Christ's resurrection).","Jackson and his father, also a photographer, are holding out hope the Midtown church will allow the photo to hang during the city's FotoFest, a biannual photography celebration that runs until the end of April.",Church officials have offered to let Jackson display his piece for a few hours on March 12 as a compromise.,"“I just want them to display it,” Jackson said as he sipped a strawberry shake recently. Most everyone agrees Jackson is a gifted artist. He's done several impressive artistic pieces featuring his 7-year-old brother Dietrich. He's also shot weddings and will photograph an upcoming culinary conference.","So it was natural that Ecclesia's Xnihilo Gallery would invite the boy to participate in its special display, for which photographers create their interpretations of Jesus' path to crucifixion.","Jackson, who was tasked with depicting Jesus' falling for a second time under the weight of his cross, batted around ideas for weeks.",He settled on covering Dietrich with fake blood and posing him with an adult friend wearing a law officer's uniform.,"“It's the innocence of Jesus as a child,” Jackson said. “And a police is like a Roman guard.”",Early one morning last month he created the picture in a field. Jackson positioned everyone just right as he shot his frames.,Later he picked out his favorite photo: It shows the officer raising a club to beat a screaming Dietrich.,"Though Ecclesia elders were impressed by Jackson's work, it made them uneasy.",What if children didn't understand the photo's symbolism? And what if it made them fearful of police or firefighters?,"“It was a tough decision, but unfortunately it's not appropriate for this stage,” said Jeremy Wells, a church elder.","And the fact that the church has featured disturbing photos before, such as a picture of a bloodied Jesus last year?","“We talk about the crucifixion. It's one thing for a child to understand a story of great sacrifice such as that,” Wells said. “It's another thing for a child to understand symbolism of this sort. Especially with child abuse, and it's not just child abuse, it's police brutality.”",Leaders considered compromises such as covering the piece with a drape. But they finally decided there was no other option but to leave out Jackson's photo.,"They agreed to display it during a reception March 12, put it on the gallery's Web site and pay Jackson some monetary compensation. They're also inviting him to submit a more appropriate piece.","Neither Jackson nor his father deems that acceptable, although they understand the church's reasoning.","“I'm not oblivious to the fact that a police officer beating a child might cause people concern,” said Jack Potts, Jackson's dad. “But the offensive image is appropriate for the stations of a cross.”",moises.mendoza@chron.com

"Ajit Pai and the FCC gutted net neutrality protections. Congress can still repeal
this decision, but time is running out. When this Congressional session is over,
it will be a lot harder to restore protections against ISPs blocking, throttling,
and imposing new fees. Contact Congress now and tell your lawmakers to sign the
CRA to support net neutrality.","The FCC’s repeal of net neutrality officially kicked in on
June 11th. The Internet as we know it won’t end overnight. But with each second
that passes until net neutrality is restored, it will be slowly dying as Internet providers like AT&T,
Verizon and Comcast
raise prices,
prioritize data, and
eliminate competition.","People are angry. And rightly so. We need to channel that anger productively and flood House lawmakers
with calls and emails demanding that they use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overrule the FCC.","So take whatever corner of the Internet that you control — whether it’s a major platform or a personal
Instagram account — and harness its reach to pressure Congress. Here’s how:","This widget will allow your site's users to send a letter to Congress by entering their

neutrality using the Congressional Review Act (CRA). But they’ll only do
it if we make them. The CRA resolution
passed the Senate 52-47 in a historic upset. But now
we’re fighting an uphill battle to get the House of Representatives to do
the same. It’s not going to be easy, but if the whole Internet comes
together to fight, we can win.","In the House, we’ll need a simple majority of sign on to a
""discharge petition” in order to force a vote past leadership
to the floor. That means we’ll need to convince all the Democrats and about 25

The girl had alleged she was raped in a field in October 2009. She was taken to hospital complaining of stomach pains. The boys, who were both 10 at the time and cannot be named, had each denied two charges of rape and two of attempted rape of a child under 13. The boys, who will not be sentenced for at least another eight weeks to allow reports to be prepared, were given bail. The jury of six men and six women were given a majority direction from the judge, Mr Justice Saunders. The boys were found guilty of attempted rape by majorities of 10 to two. They were convicted of two counts of attempted rape and cleared of two counts of rape. After delivering the verdict, the judge told jurors: ""It was an extremely difficult case.

","** (Disclaimer: Video posted strictly for educational and information purposes only) **A former assistant chief with the Evansville Police Department (EPD) has been suspended for five-days. The Evansville Police Merit Board approved Sergeant Rob Hahn's five-day suspension. The suspension resulted from Hahn's actions on the job over a month ago. According to EPD, Hahn responded to the Arrowhead Motel after receiving a tip about a man with an out-of-county, felony warrant. The body camera footage shows Hahn violating EPD's use of force policy. EPD says Hahn threw the suspect against the wall, onto the bed, and then hitting him in the groin. He reported hitting the suspect to his supervising lieutenant the day it happened. EPD tells that Hahn did not actually miss work, he missed five days of pay. We are told his suspension is over and that he is on regular duty.Donate to PoliceActivity: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivityLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivityFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","

"The following is a guest column by Chris Ahearn, President, Media at Thomson Reuters. ",“Do unto others”,"It’s a simple standard my mom taught me when I was a kid – yours probably taught it too.  It isn’t always easy, but in business it’s a good guiding light if you don’t want your company to be evil.","Recently there has been a rising crescendo of finger-pointing, shrieking, braying and teeth-gnashing about the future of the news.  In the last couple of weeks there have been many comments on the AP’s proposals, Attributor’s proposals, Ian Shapira’s story and fair use.","After some of the AP commentary, I posted a tweet directed at Jeff Jarvis that prompted some members in the community to ask me to be more outspoken, asking me to be blatant about it, to post a public statement.  For those who know me, I usually don’t need to be asked.","To start, yes the global economy is fairly grim and the cyclical aspects of our business are biting extremely hard in the face of the structural changes.  But the Internet isn’t killing the news business any more than TV killed radio or radio killed the newspaper.  Incumbent business leaders in news haven’t been keeping up.  Many leaders continue to help push the business into the ditch by wasting “resources” (management speak for talented people) on recycling commodity news.  Reader habits are changing and vertically curated views need to be meshed with horizontal read-around ones.","Blaming the new leaders or aggregators for disrupting the business of the old leaders, or saber-rattling and threatening to sue are not business strategies – they are personal therapy sessions.  Go ask a music executive how well it works.","A better approach is to have a general agreement among community members to treat others’ content, business and ideas with the same respect you would want them to treat yours.","If you are doing something that you would object to if others did it to you – stop. If you don’t want search engines linking to you, insert code to ban them.",I believe in the link economy. Please feel free to link to our stories — it adds value to all producers of content.  I believe you should play fair and encourage your readers to read-around to what others are producing if you use it and find it interesting.,"I don’t believe you could or should charge others for simply linking to your content. Appropriate excerpting and referencing are not only acceptable, but encouraged. If someone wants to create a business on the back of others’ original content, the parties should have a business relationship that benefits both.","Let’s stop whining and start having real conversations across party lines. Let’s get online publishers, search engines, aggregators, ad networks, and self-publishers (bloggers) in a virtual room and determine how we can all get along. I don’t believe any one of us should be the self-appointed Internet police; agreeing on a code of conduct and ethics is in everyone’s bestinterests.","Our news ecosystem is evolving and learning how it can be open, diverse, inclusive and effective.  With all the new tools and capabilities we should be entering a new golden age of journalism – call it journalism 3.0.  Let’s identify how we can birth it and agree what is “fair use” or “fair compensation” and have a conversation about how we can work together to fuel a vibrant, productive and trusted digital news industry.  Let’s identify business models that are inclusive and that create a win-win relationship for all parties.",This is not code for some hidden agenda – it is an open call for collective problem solving.  Let’s do it wiki-style and edit it in the public domain.  Let’s define the code of conduct and ethics we would all like to operate under.,My suggestion is we start with “do unto others” as our guiding spirit – I bet it would make all of our mothers proud.,"Post your comments below (good, bad or ugly) or send me an email. You can reach me directly at chris.ahearn@thomsonreuters.com or via twitter @cjahearn.",,"

I run a informative blog that deals with news and commentary on the banking, real estate and financial issues.  Reuters among other news sources are my source for breaking stories.  Because I didn’t create the content I do handle it in a “fair-use” way by always sourcing my material and linking back when appropriate which is usually always.  By sourcing others content, taking excerpts and linking back, I believe I am not only adding to the discussion but giving value back to the news organization by linking and giving them prominence to my readers.  Just because you can create a blog in 5 mins doesn’t mean you shouldn’t act like journalist.LJ Miehe","Chris,Its heartening to see you take a pragmatic approach to this debate. Two things are very clear- Link economy will continue to thrive with/without organizations onboard – the ones that fail to adopt it will slowly perish- Content producers need to make money or get something in return.Its about working together to figure what the return needs to be. I would encourage you to elaborate on what different options that you are willing to look at. A good number of aggregators are startups and hence money off the bat would be an issue.I do have thoughts/ideas around the same and would be happy to discuss the same with you. Lets connect on twitter – @arjunram.Kudos on a thoughtful post.Cheers!",This is why Reuters is likely to replace AP. AP alienates while Reuters collaborates: http://www.newsfuturist.com/2009/08/ap-a lienates-while-reuters-collaborates.html,"Amen Chris.It is great to see such a sensible position–and I hope that Reuters now publishes stories with permanent URLs. (I haven’t checked).To your point about ‘appropriate commercial relationships’, as media de-verticalises, there will be roles for intermediaries and distributors and media companies need to come up with ways of slicing the pie that allow distributors to play fairly.The trouble is that the mental model has been about taking a good which can be super-distributed and make it rivalrous and excludable by layering IP rights over the top.Part of the brainstorm you refer to requires players to ask the question: ‘Given we can push this out ubiquitously at low cost, what kind of relationships do we have with our distributors that can benefit all of us’?Two final thoughts:A. Apture is very cool but the use of icons before terms breaks up the eyeline and I wonder whether from a basic usability standpoint those icons shouldn’t run after your twitter name, etcB. Why not use Disqus or Echo for your comments? I would like to tweet this comment and it isn’t easy.",Great initiative Chris. My response and some suggestions have been posted to my company blog: http://blog.newscred.com/?p=200,"Good approach and I agree that the incumbent news industry is not about to just flip over and die.  It is, however, standing to make a lot less money than it used to (which is true for all industrial media segments).  The fact of the matter is that in the age of the Internet any piece of content will sooner or later get digitized and distributed on the net. Content-owners are not going to be in control over this – not through technology and not through legal means.  Hence the business of selling copies of content is far less viable – it may persist in some market, but will dwindle in the consumer market.","Great to see Reuters doing this. It would be interesting if you could clarify what you mean by this, though:”If someone wants to create a business on the back of others’ original content, the parties should have a business relationship that benefits both.”It sounds like Google News and similar services to me.","It’s good to know some organizations get it, if it weren’t for Google or Yahoo I’d probably never read any ap stories, especially the ones that are just rehashed press releases from the originating company.",[…] Reuters digital boss Chris Ahearn stands up in favor of the link economy (as opposed to someone else we know).

Our economy has suffered by a lack of creativity.  One reason is the marketplace has pushed all the risk on the creators.To “spread the risk” of creating, the market needs a 1 click transaction system that rewards quality content, media that inspires responsive audiences, and audience participation with integrity.There are multiple ways Reuters may benefit from this kind of system.  Ranging from the revenues generated from licensing its content to the new prospective content that could emerge from independent creators who would be enabled financially by a transaction system that connects quality content supply with the demand for it.Consumers are demonstrating they will pay.  Consumer purchases for media surpassed ad revenues in importance to communication revenues in 2004 (VSS).  HBO, Showtime, et al are enjoying record subscription levels and profits.Once a transaction system exists, creators and technology companies can focus on how to compete for those revenues.More here: http://twurl.nl/nmtzrjSincerely,Katherin e Warman Kernkatherine (at) comradity.com","[…] been missed by Chris Ahearn, President of Media at AP rival Thomson Reuters.

This “it is an open call for collective problem solving. Let’s do it wiki-style and edit it in the public domain.” especially. Glad you are one of us here at TR.",Thank you for the level-headed analysis. All of the shouting and finger-pointing gets so tiresome.,"You are right on. An old salesman told me, “It’s only a good deal if both parties benefit.”That advice goes for life as well as for web news and content. Keep up the good work.","As soon as I saw the Murdoch wants to start charging, I just thought I won’t be reading anything he owns. When the NYT started charging online, I stopped reading anything there, and now that they stopped that, I have no interest in them now, they lost me for good.My habit changed and I found other, better places to get news. I believe most people online like me will do the same.",[…]  http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/ 08/04/why-i-believe-in-the-link-economy/   […],Bravo!,People want to voice concerns and opinions to mold their environment. The news is only part of that. One glance at the “OPED” section of the newspaper reveals how inadequate that is for giving people a true forum. Newspapers should have a section called “Message Board” which would charge someone a minimal fee to post on a particular subject. The posts are screened and published in the newspaper. Now that would sell along with small Google-type ads next to the posts. Come on! JR,"Good ideas.  The minute any news website starts to charge, I will not view and will look for others that do not. Our local city/metro newspaper changed to 3/4 digital subscrip. and only deliver 3x a week. I stopped my subscription.","As an internet news junkie I want to thank you for your position on this matter, which is very important to me.",Wow. I’m one of those readers. I am so impressed with your words that I am still sitting here bemused. I may link to your article and send that around in email to all my contacts just to say that there is hope in today’s world. Integrity and Honesty and basic courtesy hasn’t vanished. There are others practicing it out there.May God Bless you and your business.,"I too changed where I got my news when some of the websites started charging for content.  I read much more widely now, and that’s a good thing.  Keep it up Reuters…my new homepage","Thank you. Some people, fearing change, cling to the past and old, familiar ways. The paradigm has shifted whether those dinosaurs care to acknowledge it or not. Time to adapt, New York Times. Now, if Reuters could up the culinary content and hire some more freelancers…",If you want to sell news keep it honest. Keep the bias out of it and leave the liberal and conservative slants to the op-ed pages.I really go out of my way to avoid newspapers and news sites for this reason. If I’m not reading them for free what makes them think I’ll pay to read them?,"It seems to me Murdoch has blended the lines between entertainment and news so well he now wants to be paid as an entertainer-the thing is it isn’t that good.  For free, okay, I take look. Charge me and I will readily go elsewhere. The point is most citizens already know our media has a blackout to real info. and good journalism.  The stories are weak and divulge no depth or truth, why would I pay for it?  Murdoch, your stuff isn’t that good-thank you Reuters (for now) keeping the status quo-now how about real news stories, too! When WSJ wouldn’t let me read there article off I went…your loss.","On the whole bloggers help the trad media, we link to their stories, most bloggers are not a business just an interest in a subject.   A good article will now start to link to reuters, was not sure of your policy when it came to bloggers, but it seems the bosses at Retuerns know we are in the 21 century, Excellent Article.",Simply put those who choose to impose nazi style authority on the internet will find themselves ignored and there business in decay.  In order to succeed news companies need to embrace the internet and determine how to use its strengths to profit.  I know only a few people who pay for internet content and those individuals usually limit it to something they are quite interested in or emphatic about.  Perhaps in a similar light news companies should try charging people for radio airtime.  Wait they did that sattelite radio and it is falling on its face.. Sirius and XM have merged and their combined stock is worth 50 cents a share.  Good luck to the companies commiting corporate hari kari and bravo to Reuters.,"I couldn’t agree more with Linda.  I had the same experience with the NYT.  I will never pay Rupert for his news.  Notice the ads on the top & side of this page.  The more people that visit the site, the more money Reuters make. Rupert should remember that the cost of a newspaper covered the actual printing & distribution.  Advertising is what made the profit for his papers. Create sites people want to visit by providing news without a slant.","Finally a business man with common sense.  The reason some of the other news sources are losing readership therefore profits is simple.  They have lost the ability to publish sound news and investigative reports.  Rather than present the facts they engage in slanted, biased piffle that insults the intelligence of their readers.  I did not buy the ploy when it was free and I certainly will not spend money to read any more of it.  I have always liked Reuters because they maintain a level of competence that the others have lost.  Linking stories to spread the content provides credit to the originator as is their due while furthering the spread of information which is the intent of publishing in the first place.  All benefit from the result.","[…]    Ahearn, Thomson Reuters, to AP on banning links: Go ask a music executive how well it works; http://tr.im/vKTE   […]","[…] responds to AP’s deranged attempt to charge up to $2.50 a word for content.

It is heartening to note innovation is another attribute they can add to their resume’","FOX = BIAS = RIPOFF    It’s good that you will allow people to link to your stories.  You will survive for a very long time.  Fox is all about bias and money, more bias and money, and control.  They don’t believe in fairness although they claim to.  Just watch them on TV -everything that they do is biased.  And now they want to charge you to tell you what they think.  People wake up, don’t do it.  Advertisers pay them enough money.","Refreshing to hear from someone in the news media who gets. So many are stuck in the past and refuse to adapt to the way communications and media work today.Face it, the news organizations that embrace the Internet and search will thrive. Those who still think the news business is supposed to work the way it did 30 years ago will fail.","I will NOT pay for any of greedy Rupert Murdoch’s enterprises. I won’t miss Fox as I’ve already banned it from my bookmarks because of its sleazy front page tabloidism. Actually, Murdoch has done me a favor by identifying up front all the “news” sites he owns–it will simplify my ignoring them.","I won’t be reading any news from Murdoch’s news outlets if he goes through with his plans to charge internet users to read the news.  I’ll miss the SUN and all of his other trashy papers too, NOT!I wonder when he is going to trash up the WSJ?",excellent piece and approach!

Share and […],"I have been using the Internet since the early 1990s, when you had to compile Mosaic to have a browser, and am a global news junkie.  Reuters is the site for well balanced view of news occurring around the world at any given time.  99.9% of the time, no politics, no spin, no bull and it is very hard to get that from any organization.  There are billions of web pages and tens of millions of sites but there are less than five places on the Internet that one can go to and get the type of information Reuters gives to visitors, without a fee.I know it is a balancing act some days, but if I had any suggestions they would be:  There can never be too much information.  The content of each story could be longer and more in depth.  You could increase the number of stories.  You could increase the turnover/rotation of information.I think it is time to reach out and try to make partners for carrying content.  Reach out to all of those recently laid off writers and editors!  They are valuable resources for local news, and hard hitting writing, and if you could get some of them to participate on Reuters once in a while it would be win-win.  Above all, maintain the balance.  Truth carries no affiliation to right, left, conservative, or liberal.Hang in there for all it is worth!  In the end, if there is just one place for news on the Internet and it is Reuters, we all win.Thanks!","I think it would be a great thing if both sides could come together and work it out.  I also think it would be great if we could solve global warming too.There is no way these two sides could agree.  One side has a valid point:  it costs money to report the news and it costs even more money to report well and cover production.  They are a business, just like any other, and they are there to make a profit.The other side is right as well.  Who would want to pay for something that is/has been abundantly free?  In a world so connected, news does not travel soley through the news channels as it once did.  There would be no way to police the number of people sharing information through all our varied modules of communication.  What would be the going rate for a tweet?  A text message?  A comment on a message board?Some might pay for a service, but I do not believe that the numbers will justify the course.I believe Vivian Schiller, former GM of NYtimes.com, had it right, describing the pay-for-news idea as a “mass delusion.”If you don’t believe it, like Mr. Ahearn said, just ask a record executive.  Ask them how much money they have lost to the likes of napster and kazaa.  Albums sales are down and file sharing sites are on the rise.It would be great for us all to come together and decide to play nice, but it just doesn’t work that way.  It is naive to think otherwise.  It is unfortunate, but it is the truth.I think one way to combat this would be for news sites to offer their “product” in a way that they could not get it anywhere else with an unmatched convenience.  Perhaps a way to let the users personalize their options, a la IGoogle.It’s not much, but it would be a start.","Right on, right on…In my business, I treat most customers as family and they keep coming through the door. Let’s see…that COULD be called traffic, the keep coming through the door thing? The “traffic” keeps the cash register bell ringing. DING DING DING…we have a winner! Imagine that, customer service with a “CARING” smile! That is a difficult concept for corporate America aka the scheming scrooges of capitalism who get their exercise jumping to conclusions, running each other down, stabbing their customers in the back, etc., etc., you know the drill. The Walmart founder knew a thing or two about customer service…you know, the company with the smiley face and greeters at the door? Wally World has drifted in the wrong direction in some cases and if they don’t steer the ship in the right direction, they could lose the wind in their sails, founder and sink beneath the waves. They need to honor their original Captain’s mottos and policies lest they find themselves in the watery graveyard of scrooge driven wrecks!","[…] is not lost.  There is some hope for big media.  Reuters president, Chris Ahearn, believes in the link economy.  Read it while cutting off your nose to spite your face, Associated Press. … yes the global […]",nice job,"[…] vez foi a Reuters: Our news ecosystem is evolving and learning how it can be open, diverse, inclusive and effective.

Unfortnately, I’m not sure he’d know “quality reporting” if it bit him in the backside.  News reporters have gotten so used to just taking the press releases from government officials and businesses and advertising them as “news” instead of doing a bit of investigative journalism themselves that there is no such thing as “quality journalism” anymore.","Thank-you.

It’s an absolute. Piece by piece this backwards mindset is infesting what has taken a century to build. The internet is a fantastic mode with so many applications. It should mirror the tangiable world. How can it be free? This is not a game.","Anytime, particularly in business-time, someone inserts honest values into anything it tends toward a good ending. I think that the golden rule is especially timely in todays world of he said, she did, lawsuit dystopia. A popular image is exactly that, popular. The more someone attempts to control their image, the more the situation is frustrated both inside and out. In terms of news and production of content, I agree that there is a need to recoup cost, especially when you are such a heavy lifter, as is Newscorp. Similarly, with the growing intelligence of consumers and thus related the lagging ad revenue, which I also consider blow back from pirate salesmanship and recession spending, companies need reliable income streams. Another factor that must be understood is more political. Fox News is on of the only outlets which is honestly reporting on the actions of the liberal Obama administration. While the political leanings of an individual may blind them the truthfullness of said content, it has regardless created a new industry of conservative consumers who are certainly willing to pay for honest news reporting as opposed to “state-run” media which fawns and puffs the “magic negro” so to speak. The cult of personality can only last so long, whether it is Jackson or Obama or whoever and the tides, they are a changing. What the media creates, as is the case in my humble opinion with Obama, it can also destroy and the likes of Fox News are making a killing at it. One need only look at someone the likes of Palin to understand this phenomenon where the media effectively gasped in delight for a whole two days when she was thrown into the spotlight, and has since been on a rabid feeding frenzy. Does anyone even know what exactly it is that so many people hate about this woman. She “stupid” right? Well, what kind of news is that anyway? Fox News has the American dream, and capitalism on its side. I see it making a lot of money regardless of it’s charge for news or not.

Go ask a music executive how well it works. […]","[…] Thankfully, Reuters isn’t that stupid. They encourage people to link, quote and blog their content. […]","Two thoughts. First, I agree that digitization of any information has the potential to be widely disseminated at little to no cost to the consumer. Whether it’s top secret material released illegally or music, once digitized there is risk of this occurring. A new way of researching, reporting and distributing news must be found because none of the current models are working.I believe the primary issue will be the desire for income by all parties involved in making the information available and demonstrated resistance by consumers to pay. There will be any number of political issues – new definitions of roles that may be evolving, ethics and attribution to name a few – that will arise. But I think they will be background for the battle over money.It’s only right that the people who devote their time and talent to collect and report the news should be compensated. But I keep reading the same weary line about advertising dollars or paid subscription models as the only income options. We don’t want the government to dictate the news so maybe those of us who want, need, desire, and must have reliable news need to find a way to pay as much as the news providers need to find a way and someone to charge. This isn’t optional – if we want news we are going to have to pay for it one way or another.Which brings me to my second point. How does Reuters survive during this time? I admit to knowing nothing about the company’s business model. But I suspect they are not immune to the same financial issues plaguing many information companies. I applaud their encouragement of linking and excerpting their product and I understand that the links increase income from ads but is it enough? Or is Reuters so well-situated that current income isn’t a concern? It sounds like Reuters is riding in on a white horse but I long ago learned that it’s not the color of the horse or the hat, it’s the soundness of the heart that matters.Ahearn’s comments are the first I’ve found from someone taking a broad view of new terrain and suggesting a meeting of all the players or their representatives before deciding how to proceed. It is essential that this happen soon because reliable news is critical.The old foundation is crumbling fast; I hope that a better foundation will replace it, soon.",[…] MediaFile » Blog Archive » Why I believe in the link economy | Blogs | […],"[…] been missed by Chris Ahearn, President of Media at AP rival Thomson Reuters.

","The lyrics in the video are not what he sang to the students, VanLoon said.

"Senior Editor of MAKE magazine Phil Torrone joins us to celebrate more modern-day MacGyvers as we continue DIY week at Lifehacker. Today he celebrates mischief maker and non-lethal weapons engineer (her flashlight can make you throw up) Limor ""Ladyada"" Fried.",," 
Video above: An episode of MAKE television where Ladyada shows how she developed, designed, and engineered a homemade cell phone jammer.",Advertisement,,"Lifehacker readers, you're in luck today; if you've ever wondered what a real life MacGvyer does for a living, I'm about to show you. I work with Limor at my ""other"" job designing educational electronics. It's a dream come true. Ladyada is perhaps the smartest person I've met on the planet. I've always called her ""Lex Luthor smart"" or ""MacGyver clever"", and most people seem to understand those analogies. She uses her smarts for mostly ""good"" and of course some mischief, which I would say is also good on a long enough timeline. That said, her work speaks for itself, so let's take a look and listen...",Here's what Ladyada's research page says:,"I spent the two years of my Masters of Engineering in Electrical Engineering at the Computing Culture Group in the Media Lab at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). During that time, I did some engineering, and a little thinking. You can download the 14M PDF here. In contemporary Western society, electronic devices are becoming so prevalent that many people find themselves surrounded by technologies they find frustrating or annoying. The electronics industry has little incentive to address this complaint; I designed two counter-technologies to help people defend their personal space from unwanted electronic intrusion. Both devices were designed and prototyped with reference to the culture-jamming ""Design Noir"" philosophy. The first is a pair of glasses that darken whenever a television is in view. The second is [a] low-power RF jammer capable of preventing cell phones or similarly intrusive wireless devices from operating within a user's personal space. By building functional prototypes that reflect equal consideration of technical and social issues, I identify three attributes of Noir products: Personal empowerment, participation in a critical discourse, and subversion.",Advertisement,,"She updated and released this project on Christmas day of 2006. It can also jam Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and more—perfect for schools, prisons, and coffee shops! The video above has the segment from Make: television Episode 10, public television.","Wave Bubble: a self-tuning, wide-bandwidth portable RF jammer. The device is lightweight and small for easy camouflaging: it is the size of a pack of cigarettes. An internal lithium-ion battery provides up to 2 hours of jamming (two bands, such as cell) or 4 hours (single band, such as cordless phone, GPS, WiFi, bluetooth, etc). The battery is rechargeable via a mini-USB connector or 4mm DC jack (a common size). Alternately, 3 AAA batteries may also be used. Output power is .1W (high bands) and .3W (low bands). Effective range is approximately 20' radius with well-tuned antennas. Less so with the internal antennas or poorly matched antennas. Self-tuning is provided via dual PLL, therefore, no spectrum analyzer is necessary to build this jammer and a single Wave Bubble can jam many different frequency bands - unlike any other design currently available! To reconfigure the RF bands, simply plug it into the USB port of your PC and type in the new frequencies when prompted. Multiple frequency ranges can be programmed in, each time the device is power cycled it will advance to the next program in memory. While the documentation here is both accurate and complete (as much as possible), the construction of such a device is still an advanced project. I would not suggest this as even an 'intermediate' skill project, considering the large amount of difficult SMT soldering (multiple TSSOP and SOT chips, 0603 RC's), obscure parts, and [equipment] necessary to properly construct and debug. This design is not for sale or available as a kit and never will be due to FCC regulations. Please do not ask me to assist you in such matters. All original content for this project is distributed open source under Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution / Share-Alike.",Advertisement,,"Next up, Ladyada teamed up with Mitch Altman to develop and design the high powered TV-B-Gone kit. This allows anyone to turn off any TV in public, or in private if you were so inclined. The project is used in workshops around the world to teach electronics, it's fun to use and Mitch has some good thoughts on why this might be a good idea...","How much of the TV that you watch do you really like a lot? If you could choose whatever it is that you'd like to be doing right now, anything at all, what would it be? Was your answer, ""Watch TV!""? Whatever your answer was, my wish for you is that you have time in your life to do it. Please make time in your life for what you really like. Better yet, please make time to do what you love. Wouldn't that be great? Don't know what you love? Try out a few things, see what happens.","Like all things, from chainsaws to credit cards, the TV-B-Gone can be abused. So with the mighty power of TV-turning-off-IR-LEDs, please be responsible folks—and CES is not a good place for testing these, okay?",Advertisement,,CES has no shortage of displays. And when MAKE offered us some TV-B-Gone clickers to bring to the…,"Moving along, you know all those old pagers from 1990s everyone uses? Turns out they're still around, and Ladyada demonstrates how to take a $10 pager and make a ""pager scanner"" so it can see all the pages and pager data on the pager networks. Surprisingly it's still used for a lot of interesting things and for transmitting data to many devices. (Breadboarding diagram for 2-fsk decoding here & download PDW here.) If you want to see how she got it to work, check out part one first (reverse engineering a pager).","And last but not least, a flashlight that makes you vomit (and yes, that's me in the video). The Bedazzler DIY non-lethal weaponry. She writes:","Our first open source Homeland Security non-lethal weapon project - The ""THE BEDAZZLER: A Do-it-yourself Handheld LED-Incapacitator"". After attending a conference where the $1 million ""sea-sick flashlight"" (named ""THE DAZZLER"") was demonstrated by the US Dept. of Homeland Security, we decided to create our own version. For under $250, you can build your own dazzler and we've released the source code, schematics and PCB files to make it easy. A great Arduino project for people who really like blinking LEDs. We also added in a mode selection so you can put it into some pretty color-swirl modes, great for raves and parties! Yes this project does indeed cause: Nausea, dizziness, headache, flashblindness, eye pain and (occasional?) vomiting! So don't use it on your friends or pets",Advertisement,,," 
Ladyada spends her time designing educational electronics; you can visit her project site Ladyada.net or her online store if you want to look at the kits she sells. In the video above, you can see her latest creation, a retro arcade style table tennis for two clock.",Advertisement,,"All of her kits are ""open source hardware"", meaning she gives away all the designs. You don't need to buy anything—you can make your own kits and even start a business selling them if you wanted (some have!). If you check the Maker Faire site you can see if and when a Maker Faire is in your area. Ladyada is usually at each fair and doing some type of electronics workshop. She also has a weekly video show called ""Ask an engineer"" if you need engineering questions answered, too.","Throughout the week I picked my favorite makers—I've got more than five, of course—but what I wanted to say in closing is that we're all makers, we all start out making things. Somewhere along the way many of us lose that feeling of creating something and sharing it. My hope is that you've been inspired by one or all of these makers, and I'm looking forward to seeing your projects here on Lifehacker. I'd like to thank the Lifehacker gang and all of the great discussions, comments and support. The makers profiled really appreciate it and I really enjoyed doing this. See you soon, and keep making!",Advertisement,,"Phil Torrone is Senior Editor of MAKE magazine, contributing editor to Popular Science, and creative director of Adafruit Industries, where they make educational electronics and kits like the TV-B-Gone and some ""other"" hacky projects that sometimes make the rounds in these parts of the web. You may have seen MAKE in bookstores, public television, online, or been to one of their Maker Faires (there will be 3 this year, they are expecting over 100k attendees!).

","In the middle of custody proceedings, CPS (Child Protective Services) upon an anonymous called-in complaint, swoops in and charges me with child neglect and inadequate guardianship. This video was taken during an hour long interrogation of me, microanalysing my every otherwise perfectly normal interactions with my daughter, and somehow trying to spin it to make it look evil and incompetent. These were not helpful suggestions or counseling, but edicts imposed upon threat of, and in fact the eventual, removal of my daughter from my life, which they did 5 days after this video was taken.Their charges consisted of my going to McDonalds with my daughter (5 times in three months), having chicken McNuggets, letting her have sugar-free soda and decaf coffee, weighing her on our bathroom scale, and responding to her alarming symptoms to an unknown medication by trying to look it up on the internet with her.For this, they filed a petition in Family Court and took her away from me, slapped a restraining order on me to stay away from her, and effectively gave her mother custody without a custody trial. It should be noted that none of the things they charged me with constitute neglect, and are in fact normal parenting discretions and care that millions of parents do with their kids every day.The fact that this specious court action against me was effected right in the middle of a custody dispute was no accident, and was timed to affirmatively interfere in that proceeding, so as to prejudice the proceedings against me, and give de facto custody to the mother.It might be noted that this particular charge was eventually overturned, dismissed and sealed on administrative appeal, but only after months of my child being taken away from me during which time I was viewed by all I knew as a suspected child abuser. It might also be noted that it was the second of three cases CPS has, so far, launched against me, all either dismissed or found in my favor. The gender discrimination was palpable in this CPS agency, who believed their goal was to ensure custody to mothers, and that men are incapable of taking care of their children.They accomplish this by misusing their public trust, abusing the powers of the state, and officially pillorying fathers via frivolous charges, but charges that would nonetheless each time result in a restraining order keeping me away from my child, and lasting for months or years while they accomplished their real agenda in assisting mothers to win custody.(It is evidenced even here, by their total dismissal and unconcern of several things the mother did, that easily raise to the level of neglect - abandoning our child and leaving her locked out of the apt., not informing me of serious psychiatric medications she is on while I had her on visits, and a month later again losing our kid in a department store. These were of no concern to CPS, but our McDonalds visits or soda drinking was. Their gender prejudice is so embedded, they don't even see it.)If any here wish to view the whole story to date, please visit:http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/...http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-righ...[Also see AVFM News RadioSep 10, 2013 archived podcast of that program can be found at:http://www.blogtalkradio.com/avoicefo...

","March 14, 2014:  Bill (I'm no longer calling him a father) has lost the primary election in Aransas County and will hopefully never be a judge again. Any sympathy or Stockholm Syndrome I ever had for that monster is gone. Please ignore anything nice I ever said about him. He tortured me and my mother for decades on end and I'm glad he's out of the picture. He forced my mother to discipline me the way HE wanted, which is what you see in the video. It wasn't her choice, and to blame her for ANYTHING is to side with the abuser. Learn about the abuser's systems of control here: https://www.psychopathfree.comLearn about the effects of violence on children here: http://www.stopspanking.org/January 10, 2012:  Please, someone help me.  He thinks he's a hero, he thinks he has done nothing wrong and he is some kind of martyr.  He is actively lying to and trying to bribe my little sister.  He told me he ""wasn't mad"" to elicit kindness and then blocked my phone number.  He promised me my school savings in return for the car and he still has every penny AND the car.  He threw away every single chance I gave him at redemption.  This shit is still happening and this man is still in office, denying any wrongdoing and shifting blame in any outward direction he can.  Please god someone help us.2004:  Aransas County Court-At-Law Judge William Adams took a belt to his own teenage daughter as punishment for using the internet to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time.  She has had ataxic cerebral palsy from birth that led her to a passion for technology, which was strictly forbidden by her father's backwards views.  The judge's wife was emotionally abused herself and was severely manipulated into assisting the beating and should not be blamed for any content in this video.  The judge's wife has since left the marriage due to the abuse, which continues to this day, and has sincerely apologized and repented for her part and for allowing such a thing, long before this video was even revealed to exist.  Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgement as a parent himself.  Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again.  His ""judgement"" is a giant farce.  Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter.","

","Here's Reason.tv Producer Jim Epstein's account of what happened: On June 22, 2011, I attended a meeting of the D.C. Taxi Commission for a story I'm currently working on about a proposed medallion system in the district.About half-an-hour into the meeting, I witnessed journalist Pete Tucker snap a still photo of the proceedings on his camera phone. A few minutes later, two police officers arrested Tucker. I filmed Tucker's arrest and the audience's subsequent outrage using my iphone.A few minutes later, as I was attempting to leave the building, I overheard the female officer who had arrested Tucker promise a woman, who I presumed to be an employee of the Taxi Commission, that she would confiscate my phone. Reason intern Kyle Blaine, overheard her say, ""Do you want his phone? I can get his phone.""(The woman who was given assurances by the officer that she could havemy phone can be seen at the end of the video telling me, ""You do nothave permission to record this!"")As I tried to leave, I was told by the same blond female officer to ""stay put."" I told her I was leaving and attempted to exit the building. I was then surrounded by officers, and told to remain still or I would be arrested.I didn't move, but I tried to get the attention of a group of cab drivers who were standing nearby. At this point I was arrested.I spent the remainder of the day in a cell in the basement of the building. I was released at about 4PM.Go to Reason.com for more reporting on this issue, and to http://Reason.tv for downloadable versions of this video.Subscribe to Reason.tv's YouTube Channel to receive notifications as new material goes live.","

              ",Hundreds of students at Murry Bergtraum High School rioted through the hallways today after the school’s principal told teachers not to give out bathroom passes.,"Teachers at the lower Manhattan school said that the day began with a fight between two students on the building’s third floor. After the fight, Bergtraum principal Andrea Lewis reportedly announced over the school’s loud speaker that in the future, students who fought would be arrested. Lewis reportedly told students and staff that for the rest of the day, the school’s bathrooms would be closed and teachers should not issue bathroom passes.","In a school of over 2,600 students, this news did not sit well.","“She also said that in the case of emergency, kids could use the bathrooms in the nurse’s office, but by then, given the nature of adolescents, the message had been delivered that the bathrooms would be shut,” a teacher said.","Within minutes, students were on their cell phones, which they are not allowed to bring into the school. Messages traveled from student to student, saying there would be a riot. During fifth period, hundreds of students began running through the fourth floor hallways at top speed, screaming and shouting. By the beginning of sixth period it had spread to the basement. Teachers said they locked their classrooms to keep their students inside while school safety officers tried to end the riot, which teachers said went on for about 20 minutes.","“They actually filled the halls from one side to the other,” said a teacher. He said one of his students had an asthma attack as she tried to make her way up a staircase while students poured down.","Formerly the principal of Acorn Community High School, Lewis came to Bergtraum this year. As an executive principal, she received a $25,000 yearly bonus for agreeing to lead the struggling school for at least three years. Though Murry Bergtraum has received low grades on its annual progress reports, the city does not have plans to close it.",Stay on top of New York education news with our morning newsletter.,"“I didn’t even know what I was missing, but as soon as Chalkbeat’s info started rolling in, it was like a part of my brain just started lighting up. You need what they have to offer.” — Tim L.","“This was a principal that was sent to the school to turn the school around, however her record has been one of success in academics,” said teachers union chapter leader John Elfrank-Dana.","“She has failing grades for security from her previous school. That is a concern of the staff,” he said.","After the riot, students went on Twitter to broadcast the news and threaten to riot again tomorrow.","“Bergtraum is gonna get closed down, there was riots in every floor every period,” wrote one student.","“Riotin all day cause the f-n principal is blowin ours and cut off the bathroom use all day,” wrote another.","A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said that one of the two students in the initial fight was sent to the hospital and released, but no other injuries have been reported. She said the incident is under investigation.","

              ","Thousands of Newark students have already missed multiple school days this year, newly released data show, even as the district’s new superintendent makes improving attendance a top priority. ","About one in five students missed more than a week’s worth of class during the first three months of school, according to the district data. Those roughly 8,000 students are already considered “chronically absent.”","Newark has long grappled with exceptionally high rates of chronic absenteeism, which is defined as missing 10 percent or more of school days in an academic year for any reason. Students who miss that much school tend to have lower test scores, higher dropout rates, and greater odds of getting in trouble with the law.","The district’s new superintendent, Roger León, has promised to attack the issue — even going so far as to set a district goal of 100 percent attendance. But the new data, which León released this week, show how far the district has to go.","Nearly 9 percent of of the district’s 36,000 students have already missed the equivalent of more than two school weeks, according to the data. Those 3,200 or so students are labeled “severely chronically absent.”","Experts say that tracking and publicizing attendance data, as León has done, is the first step in combating absenteeism. Now, some district leaders are calling for the next phase of work to begin — analyzing why so many students are missing class and taking steps at the district and school level to help get them to school.","“It’s great that we have all this great data,” Newark Board of Education member Kim Gaddy said at a board meeting last month. “But if you have the data and you’re not using the data to change the situation, we won’t do any justice to our children in this district.”",Start your week strong with the most important education news in Newark,"“Chalkbeat gives you an authoritative, at-a-glance overview of major education news and topics, both local and national.” — Megan M.","Students who missed six or more school days from September through November qualify as chronically absent. If they continue at that pace, they are on track to miss the equivalent of a month or more of school by June. Students who missed 10.5 days or more during those three months count as severely chronically absent.","The early data show that Newark’s long-standing absenteeism patterns are continuing. The chronic absenteeism rates over the past three months were about the same as in 2016, according to the data.","The problem remains most acute among the district’s youngest and oldest students: 41 percent of pre-kindergarteners were chronically absent this November, as were 45 percent of 12th-graders. At least a third of students at five high schools — Barringer, Central, Malcolm X Shabazz, Weequahic, and West Side — were severely chronically absent last month.","While absenteeism rates varied among schools, they tended to be highest in the city’s impoverished South Ward.","“I’m concerned particularly about the South Ward,” Gaddy said at the Nov. 20 board meeting. “That’s where our children need the most assistance.”","León, a former principal who became schools chief on July 1, has already taken some early steps to improve attendance. ","His most visible effort was a back-to-school campaign called “Give Me Five,” where he ordered every district employee to call five families before the first day of school. The campaign, for which León himself recorded robocalls to families, appears to have made a difference: 91 percent of students showed up the first day, the highest rate of the past four years, according to district data. (In 2013, when former Superintendent Cami Anderson launched her own attendance campaign, about 94 percent of students attended school the first day.)","The district also eliminated some early-dismissal days, which typically have low attendance. And students with mid-level test scores whom León has targeted for extra support have had better attendance this year than their peers, officials said.","However, León hit a snag trying to enact the crux of his attendance plan — reinstating more than 40 attendance counselors whom Anderson laid off years ago to cut costs. The state’s civil service commission has said the district must offer the jobs to the laid-off counselors before hiring anyone new, León told the board — forcing the district to track down former employees who, in some cases, have moved to different states. Only eight counselors have been hired to date, but León said he hopes to fill the remaining positions next month.","Meanwhile, León is arguing that some of the responsibility for improving attendance falls on families. At November’s board meeting, he said some parents and guardians “believe that, in fact, they can keep their children home” from school. At a parent conference this month, he took that message directly to families.","“I don’t care if school ends at 10 and they’re only going to come for an hour, and half an hour is on a bus,” he told several hundred parents who showed up for the daylong summit. “When I tell you that your child is coming to school, it’s your job to make sure the child comes to school.”","Afterwards, several parents and school employees said they welcomed León’s tough talk on attendance.","“It was about parents ensuring kids are in school and they are doing good,” said Bilikis Oseni, who has a child in first grade at Camden Street School. “Attendance is very key.”","Still, Newark families face many obstacles in getting their children to school, according to a 2016 report on chronic absenteeism among young students. Parents cited a lack of school busing, asthma and other childhood health problems, and work schedules that make it hard to drop off their children in the morning. High school students listed uninspiring classes, mental-health challenges, and safety concerns when traveling to school as reasons why they don’t show up, according to a 2017 report.","At the November board meeting, several members asked León whether he planned to dig deeper into the causes of absenteeism.","“I was looking through all the statistics here in the packet,” said Andre Ferreira, the board’s student representative, who attends Science Park High School. “But there were none that looked towards having a survey of students themselves telling you why they aren’t coming to school.”",León noted that he held forums with high-school students in September where he stressed the importance of showing up. He also said he has a student-only email address that some students have used to explain why they miss school.,"“So I’m gathering data that lets me know why a particular student in fact hasn’t been to school,” he said. “Ultimately, we would have to do that for every single student, in every classroom, in every grade, in every school. That’s really the work — and it’s hard to do.”","Peter Chen, who co-authored the two reports on chronic absenteeism in Newark, said the superintendent had taken a crucial first step by raising awareness about the city’s attendance challenges. The district also appears to be sharing attendance data more regularly with schools, he said.","The next step is for the district to help schools identify and assist students who are chronically absent. The central office can do that by sharing effective attendance strategies, training school workers on how to support students’ social and emotional well-being, and offering grants to fund schools’ own attendance campaigns, he added. ","“This is something that requires tailored, school-level responses,” said Chen, who is a policy counsel for Advocates for Children of New Jersey. “The district can help support some of that — but it’s not something that’s easy to impose from on high.”","

              ",Newark students will soon face a new hurdle when trying to snag seats at the city’s most popular high schools.,"Next month, any student who wants into one of the city’s six magnet schools will have to take a new exam that gauges their academic prowess as well as their interest in each school’s theme. ","“If you would like to go to any of those schools,” Superintendent Roger León told parents at a conference Wednesday, “you better get ready for the test to get in.”","The exam, which will be given to students on Jan. 11-12, has not yet been announced on the district’s enrollment site. In fact, the test itself is still being developed and logistical details, such as where students will take it, are still being determined, officials said.","In addition to the new test, each school will also begin interviewing applicants, León said — something only two magnet schools did last year, according to an admissions guide. It’s unclear whether the interviews will take place this admission cycle. If so, schools may have to schedule dozens or even hundreds of interviews in the coming weeks. ","Meanwhile, enrollment for next school year began on Dec. 3 and continues through February — giving students and schools little time to prepare for the new requirements.","“I know as much as you know right now,” one principal said. “Obviously the superintendent is revamping some items, but he hasn’t really shared the details with everyone.”",Start your week strong with the most important education news in Newark,"“Chalkbeat gives you an authoritative, at-a-glance overview of major education news and topics, both local and national.” — Megan M.","The district-run magnet schools, which have themes such as science and American history, include some of the city’s most sought-after high schools. Last year, nearly 1,800 eighth-graders listed a magnet school first on their high-school applications even though the schools had space for only 971 students.","The magnets, which vastly outperform the district’s six traditional high schools, already screen applicants. They look at grades, state test scores, attendance records, and — in the case of Arts High School — an audition or visual-art portfolio, when deciding which students to let in.","But even with those screens, some admitted students are not prepared for the rigor of work at the magnets or lack a strong interest in their programs, León said.","“The idea is to make sure that students who choose to go to these schools are going to meet whatever are the demands of that school,” he told Chalkbeat. “It’s not that your parents have the right to choose for you to go.”","Even as he moves to make magnet schools more selective, León — who became superintendent in July — also hopes to make traditional schools more appealing to top students.","On Wednesday, he also announced plans to create gifted-and-talented programs at each of the traditional high schools. To qualify, students will also take the new magnet-school exam.","León did not go into detail about what the programs will entail. But he may be drawing from his previous experience as principal of University High School, a magnet school that advertises a gifted-and-talented program on its website. Students must test into the program, which includes a “rigorous curriculum” in English, math, and another language, according to the site.","“Students are going into magnets because they think that’s where they can get their high-performing education,” he said. “Now they’ll be given a reason to not do that.”","The traditional schools will also develop specialized “academies” to train students for various careers, including engineering, teaching, and health services. Each school will partner with a higher-education institution and a professional organization to develop those programs. ","Many Newark schools have tried to offer vocational programs, but often struggle to find qualified teachers and meet the stringent requirements to receive federal funding. It’s unclear how the district will help them overcome those challenges, especially if the timeline is also aggressive.","Traditional schools, for their part, seem eager for any support they can get. Angela Mincy, principal of Barringer High School, said the school created an honors program last year in an effort to retain high-achieving students.","“If I don’t create an isolated experience for them, I will lose them,” she said in an interview last month, adding that the goal is to keep attracting more and more top students. “The hope is that one day, one honors track will become two will become three.”","With their selective admissions and college-oriented courses, the city’s magnet schools have long been seen as a refuge for high-achieving students who cannot afford private school. County-run vocational schools, which also screen applicants, are another popular option along with some charter high schools — though they often have few seats left over for students who did not attend their lower-grade schools.","The district’s traditional, or “comprehensive,” high schools are viewed by many families as schools of last resort. On nearly every academic measure — attendance rates, test scores, college enrollment and completion — the traditional schools lag far behind the magnets.","In a sense, this disparity is built into the system. Magnet schools are designed to enroll academically and artistically accomplished students. Traditional schools take the rest, including almost all students who are still learning English and the majority of those with disabilities.","Other cities have begun to rethink this practice of tracking students into separate schools according to ability — at least as measured by a single test. In New York City, where a debate has raged over admissions to the district’s coveted “specialized” high schools, the mayor has proposed scrapping the schools’ entrance exam. Instead, he said, they should reserve spots for the top students from every middle school.","Some Newark parents have floated a similar plan for the city’s most exclusive magnet school, Science Park High School. Instead, Superintendent León is pursuing the opposite approach — adding new entrance exams for all magnet schools. In other cities, exam schools tend to be highly segregated by race and class, favoring families with the wherewithal to help students prepare for the exams or pay for test prep.","León said he expects the new magnet exams will measure students’ reading and math proficiency, as well as their interest in each school’s particular focus, such as science or technology.","“The whole concept that anyone and everyone can get into the magnet high schools — that’s not why they were designed,” said León, who graduated from Science High School. “You actually have to qualify to get into those schools.”","Karen Gaylord, Science Park High School’s community engagement specialist, said some teachers and  parents may grumble about the new test because they haven’t had a chance to prepare students for it. But she noted that families had become “resigned” to entrance exams when magnet schools used them in the past.","She also said many people would welcome the admissions interviews as a way for students to highlight skills and interests that aren’t reflected on their transcripts. The question, she said, is how schools will carry out these changes on such a tight timeline.","“It feels like there are so many opportunities to get this right,” she said. “I’m just not sure we’re going to get them all in this year. The clock is ticking.”",Email Address:,Select Edition:

"A police officer abused his power, kidnapped a mentally diminished woman from a hospital, handcuffed her, raped her on the hood of his car, and he is only doing 90 days.","In August of 2017, Curtis Lee Arganbright, a Westminster police officer, was asked to take an unruly woman home from the hospital. She was allegedly attempting to steal items belonging to the Emergency Room after checking herself in for alcoholism. But instead of getting the woman safely home, Arganbright took her down a dark road and raped her on the front of his car while she was still in handcuffs.","Instead of felony charges for sex assault by force, sex assault by a person in a position of authority and false imprisonment, the officer reached a plea deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to lesser misdemeanors of unlawful sexual contact and official misconduct. As a result of the sweetheart deal, some have alleged, Arganbright now only has to serve 90 days in jail followed by four years probation, and has to register as a sex offender.",Criminal defense attorney Dan Recht told Denver’s Channel 7 news the prosecution likely believed they did not have enough evidence in court to get a felony conviction. Recht described the difficult scenario.,"They have a victim that was intoxicated. An officer saying that she was sexually aggressive and he foolishly and unlawfully reacted and was sexual, but that it was consensual…At the end of the day. It’s clearly he said, she said. Except that he’s a police officer and it’s an abuse of power.","We at TFTP consulted a former Emergency Room Nurse who said she would never have discharged a patient to the care of a police officer to get a personal ride home. “No, never! You call a cab, or a family member, but you don’t turn someone over to the police. I’ve never discharged a patient to the police. That’s a personal favor, not a fiduciary responsibility. Police are not there to give people rides home.”","This also may mean the hospital is liable for discharging someone to another person who ultimately raped her. The former ER nurse continued by describing the process of how ER personnel follow the principal of “MTF” meaning Metabolize to Freedom. In other words, hospitals can place patients in chemical or physical restraints if they’re a danger to themselves or others—so, she could conceivably been placed in restraints. “Patient safety is preached so often in the hospital that I just don’t even know what to say about how this happened to the woman,” she said.",According to News 7:,"The victim wasn’t physically able to attend the sentencing hearing, but the district attorney’s office said her mother told the judge her daughter was brutally raped and suffers from extreme PTSD because of what Arganbright did.","Nevertheless, once again, a police officer who was responsible to protect and serve the public used his position of authority to engage in sexual activity with a suspect. As TFTP has reported, several states allow police officers to engage in sex with people they make official police contact with, without recourse, so long as the sex is consensual.",,"Another such allegation which TFTP is monitoring closely is the case of Anna Chambers, a teenager who said she was raped by two NYPD detectives, Eddie Martins and Richard Hall, in the back of a police van, while she too was handcuffed, in custody, for possessing drugs. Chambers vehemently denies the sex was consensual although the two detectives claim it was.","In Chambers’ case, lawyers for the two disgraced NYPD officers (who have since resigned) are now engaged in the practice of victim shaming, according to Chambers’ lawyer, Michael David. David says the officers’ lawyers have brought up Chambers’ past drug use, how her story changed several times under deposition, and how she cannot remember what clothes she was wearing the night she alleges she was raped. David contends, however, such a focus ultimately results in victim shaming and victimizing the alleged victim over and over again. David told NY Daily News:",She’s just like almost any other teenager today…Teens experiment with drugs. It’s irrelevant…They are trying to blow up everything to confuse things…They brutally raped her. This is probably the worst crime in the history of the NYPD.,It’s time to end the practice of allowing police officers to have sex while on duty with members of the public and even each other. Such actions force a he said/she said scenario where the lines of justice are blurred. Below is a video created by Aljazeera English about Chambers’ quest for justice.,Thank you for making a video to share my story I appreciate everyones support so much. https://t.co/dh44dskhzu,"— Anna Chambers (@annaaachambers) October 24, 2017",,"

"According to local reports, there were five search warrants issued in the murder of Botham Jean and none of them were for the apartment of Amber Guyger.","Dallas, TX — On Sunday, activists rallied around the Dallas Cowboy’s stadium to draw attention to the slaying of Botham Jean. They carried coffins and blocked traffic to expose the special treatment of Amber Guyger, the cop who has yet to even be fired for killing Jean. Now, as more details emerge, this special treatment has moved to a level that is even more insidious.",Protest at AT&T Stadium pic.twitter.com/lu5VsGQByv,"— Allison Harris (@AllisonFox4News) September 16, 2018",,"From the beginning of this case, it was clear that Guyger was receiving special treatment from law enforcement. One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger’s “verbal commands.” Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this?","Attorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that “The affidavit isn’t written objectively, not at the slightest. As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused. An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion. This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.”","What’s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger’s apartment. ","For those who don’t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean’s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body. They attempted to assassinate Jean’s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment. However, they failed miserably at it. ","One thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn’t release any information on what they found in Guyger’s apartment. According to the information currently available, that’s because they didn’t search it.","According to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case—none of which were for the killer’s apartment. As WFAA reports:","Two of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean’s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks. An inventory return states that they removed both of their door lock and downloaded the data from the door locks.","A third search warrant gave investigators the authority to enter Jean’s apartment and collect additional evidence. A return shows that investigators took photographs of his apartment, made videos of his apartment, conducted “laser measurements of firearm trajectory,” and collected “gunshot residue” from the door frame and kitchen wall of Jean’s apartment.",A return for the fourth search warrant shows investigators seized video from the surveillance camera system in the apartment management’s office.,"A fifth search warrant gave investigators the authority to obtain all communications related to the incident in the possession of property management, as well as all surveillance video and all entry and access logs from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the night of the shooting.","An inventory return shows investigators seized a USB drive containing the video, an event log report for “linear access doors and gates,” an “elevator access door lock” report and a “lock audit report for both apartments.","Now, even if police would try to search the killer cop’s apartment, it’s too late. On Sunday, apartment staff notified residents in an email that Guyger “has vacated her apartment and no longer resides at our community.”","A manager at the complex declined to indicate exactly when Guyger moved out and if she left the premises voluntarily, the Dallas Morning News reports.","While residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them, the family of Botham Jean likely sees this as one more instance of injustice.","Mother of #BothamJean, Allison Jean, says the “smear” of her son is unacceptable. “It is time that we recognize that lives matter, my son’s life matters.” pic.twitter.com/UjyKRZ8XeG","— Jack Highberger (@JackHighberger) September 14, 2018",, , ,"

Multiple California cops were caught on video savagely beating a teen and then lying to cover it up. Now they are on trial.,"Los Angeles, CA — A visit to the LA county fair turned into a police brutality nightmare for Christian Aguilar, who was beaten and tased for doing nothing other than filming the police. Now, because someone bravely decided to film that nightmare, the police who caused it are going to trial for their crimes.",Three officers with the Pomona Police Department were indicted last year for alleged civil rights violations that occurred during the arrest of then-16-year-old Christian Aguilar.,"As KTLA reports, a federal prosecutor in the criminal trial of two Pomona police officers charged in a violent encounter with a teenager told jurors Tuesday that a video showing cops pummeling the teen would prove the officers’ guilt, while defense attorneys countered the same footage would help to vindicate the men.","Last year, Sgt. Michael Neaderbaomer, Officer Chad Jensen and Officer Prince Hutchinson pleaded not guilty to multiple counts, including use of force, witness tampering, and falsifying records, all stemming from the September 16, 2015, incident.","The officers allegedly wrote a false police report to “justify the use of force” against Aguilar, who was not named in the federal indictment. The report claims the teen came within arm’s length of another officer who was arresting a suspect and then attempted to punch Jensen in the face, while trying to “incite unrest,” reports CBS.","However, none of the alleged incitement of unrest was apparent in the video, thus the indictment of three cops.","In 2015, after the Pomona Police officers beat the teen, they maliciously charged him, his parents, and the uninvolved man who filmed the boy’s assault.","According to the man who filmed the beating, Robert Hansen, police confiscated his camera, arrested him, and edited the video before submitting it for the investigation.","Eventually, all charges against Hansen, Aguilar, and Aguilar’s parents were dropped — but not before cops lied to cover the incident up. The video below, however, does not lie.","As he watched his parents get arrested, Aguilar merely attempted to film the interaction. His freedom of speech was then met with heavy police violence.","According to a report by Photography is Not a Crime at the time, ","As is clear in the video, Aguilar didn’t ever challenge the first officer on the scene’s use of inappropriate force, when Officer Jensen smashed his head into a fence  – instead putting his hands at his sides and thrusting his chin forward in a posture of frustrated readiness.", ,"Officer Jensen thrust his forearm into Aguilar’s face twice at maximum thrust, before Pomona Officers Hutchinson and Correa arrived.", ,"Hutchinson thoughtfully held the teenager along with Jensen, and that’s when Pomona Officer landed a devastating blow, with his long black baton to Christian Aguilar’s knee, sending the teenager to the ground.", ,"As the three grown men beat the teenager, another Pomona Officer came over an discharged his taser near the teen to strike terror.","“In the criminal trial, after watching the officers’ explanations of the discrepancies between the full video and their police reports unravel during cross examination,” said the family lawyer David Gammill, of the Los Angeles based Geragos Law Firm, and that, “The judge dismissed Christian’s criminal case before the defense ever had to call a single witness.”","“It’s heartbreaking to see your kid suffer like that,” said Aguilar. “And then to know that these guys swore an oath (are) deliberately lying to cover it up.”","According to the Geragos firm, Ignacio Aguilar was a highly regarded cardiac nurse and was forced out of his job by the slanderous allegations. Christian Aguilar’s mother Eraine Aguilar has been in law enforcement since 2001 and was sickened by the conduct of Pomona PD.","When Eraine Aguilar went to the Pomona police department to file a complaint, she says she was intimidated as well.","The family filed a lawsuit against the Pomona police department and the city has paid out $500,000 to settle it.","“If convicted, the charges of excessive force carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, the charges of witness tampering and falsifying records carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and the charges of false statements to federal agents carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison,” the indictment reads.","“I’m glad the FBI flashed their light down our road to brighten it up,” Ignacio Aguilar said.",,"

"When a man asked police to see the warrant they claimed to have, instead of showing it to him, they choked him to death on video. ","Marksville, LA — Last year, Armando Frank was sitting on his tractor when he was approached by police who were going to serve him a warrant for alleged trespassing. When Frank asked to see the warrant — which the cops never produced — he was tasered, choked, pulled from his tractor and killed. In the attack caught on video, never once did Frank try to hurt the officers.","As the police body camera video shows, within just a few moments of confronting Frank, officers grow agitated with his passive resistance. Frank is merely asking to see the warrant the officers claim to have, but they do not produce it, nor did they give him any reason for the arrest.","Instead, Frank is told to come with them downtown where they will show him the warrant. This was an idea that Frank did not like, so he merely sat there on his tractor in the parking lot of a Walmart.","During the incident, which took place Oct 20, 2017, two Avoyelles Parish sheriff’s deputies, Brandon Spillman and Alexander Daniel, along with Marksville Police officer Kenneth Parnell, tried to force Frank from his tractor. All three cops are named in a recent lawsuit on behalf of Frank’s estate.","According to a report in the Acadiana Advocate, a forensic pathologist hired by the parish had said in a report that manual strangulation was the primary cause of Frank’s death. The video shows Spillman mount the tractor behind Frank and apply a choke hold while another officer tries to pull him down. For a time, Frank is doubled-over while resisting. Officers had to carry Frank to a patrol car after his body went limp.","“His level of resistance starts out as passive. It doesn’t go to active and aggressive until he’s physically assaulted by these deputies,” Gregory Gilbertson, director of the criminal justice program at Centralia College in Centralia, Washington, said, according to the report.",Gilbertson explained that Franks’ requests to see the warrant and questions over what he was being arrested for were reasonable. But the officers involved wanted no part in answering those questions.,"“There’s no exigent circumstance here,” Gilbertson said Thursday. “He’s not attempting to flee, he’s not assaulting anybody, he’s sitting on a tractor and he’s asking reasonable questions they are refusing to answer.”",Gilbertson explained that there was no need for the officer to restrict Frank’s airflow with the choke hold when all he wanted was to know what he was being arrested for.,"“Most agencies now only authorize their officers to use it in ground-fighting situations where deadly force is their only other option,” Gilbertson said. “They might have pacified Mr. Frank if he had known what the warrant was for.”","Sadly, this was not the case. Instead brute force was used until the life was pulled from Frank’s body. What’s more, after he went limp and stopped breathing, officers completely ignored him. Had they acted during this time, they could’ve possibly saved his life. But they did not. And Frank died for asking for a warrant.","Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University, who said the use of force by the officers was acceptable, also stated that the officers could be liable for negligence for failing to assist Frank once he went unconscious.","“Once they got him on the ground and he’s dead weight, at that point I think it’s time to check his airway,” Stinson said. “He was unconscious. He had stopped breathing at that point at a minimum, it seems to me.”",The officers involved all went up in front of a grand jury in March who predictably refused to indict them.,"The warrant for Frank was over a property dispute with his neighbors who accused him of trespassing. He hadn’t physically harmed anyone or otherwise destroyed property or stolen anything. He was simply accused of being somewhere he shouldn’t have been—and for this, he would lose his life.","For those who may not recall, Frank was killed in the same town and by the same department who murdered 6-year-old Jeremy Mardis. Mardis was shot and killed by two cops as he sat buckled in to the front seat of his dad’s truck.",Below is this disturbing video that shows just how far situations can be escalated for simply asking for a warrant.,, ,"

Florida police are getting some unwanted attention after one of their officers was filmed punching a 14-year-old girl while grabbing her shorts.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL — The Coral Springs police department is under the spotlight this week after a video has gone viral of one of their officers repeatedly punching a 14-year-old girl. Naturally, the department is telling the public to reserve judgement as the video does not show the entire story.",The video was uploaded to Instagram over the weekend and shows two officers—one male and one female—hold down the girl. The male officer then grabs the girl by her shorts and unleashes his fury with his fists.,"“Why you hitting her?” someone in the video yells. “She can’t do that, her hands underneath her, the f*** you hitting her for?”",As WGN9 reports:,"The police department in Coral Springs, about 30 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale, said in a statement on Facebook on Friday that the video does not show the entire incident that led to the arrest.","Police said the incident took place Thursday when officers were called to Coral Square Mall about unruly teens who had been harassing people and causing a disturbance. When officers met with mall security, a mother told officers one of the teens shoved her 5-year-old child to the ground. Mall security also told officers one of the teens hit another teen. Officers issued a trespassing warning to the unruly teens and barred them from the mall.","The teens then returned to the mall, police said, where a boy was taken into custody without incident, but the girl in the video began cursing and attempted to rile up the other teens. Officers tried to take the girl into custody, but police said she began to fight and resist arrest. It was at this time, police said, that they took the girl to the ground because of “her stature and aggressive behavior” and tried to get her to release her fists.","“As seen in the video she resisted arrest, and in order to have her to comply she was struck in the side to release her clenched fists – she was then handcuffed,” the Coral Springs Police Department said in its Facebook statement.","As officers were trying to put her in the patrol car, police said she “violently kicked” one of the officers.","“The Coral Springs Police Department believes in transparency,” the department’s statement read. “It is important for people to have all of the facts before rushing to judgment of an officer’s actions when faced with calls for service involving violent suspects — regardless of their age or gender.”",The girl’s mother disagrees and says her daughter was clearly not resisting.,"“She clearly wasn’t aggressive. Everyone could see she was laying there,” the girls mother, Jessica Dennis said. “So I just want justice to be served.”",Dennis explained that she has since hired an attorney who noted that the officer used excessive force.,"“It’s clear from the video that my client was on the ground,” attorney Meeghan Moldof told WSVN. “Her hands are under her belly, the officer’s knees are on her back, and he’s just gut-shotting her, like one after another.”",Video shows arrest of 14-year-old girl who police say was acting aggressively & resisting arrest at Coral Square Mall when she was taken to ground and punched by officer https://t.co/J3xJWougs5 pic.twitter.com/1UGKK7wAgF,"— WPLG Local 10 News (@WPLGLocal10) October 19, 2018",,"

"For walking across the road in a manner not fit for the police state, otherwise known as jaywalking, a man was followed into the bathroom by police and killed. ","Eagle Point, OR — A family is heartbroken this week after learning that the officers who took their son’s life will not be charged and were ruled justified in his killing—over improperly crossing the street. Matthew Graves, 33, was shot in the back twice by police last month after they followed him into a Carl’s Jr. bathroom because they suspected him of jaywalking.","Prior to his interaction with police, Graves was unarmed, had harmed absolutely no one, had no warrants, and was simply walking to Carl’s Jr. to get a bite to eat. However, because he crossed the road in a manner not fit for the police state—otherwise known as jaywalking—Graves would be killed in cold blood by public servants and die on the floor of a fast food restaurant bathroom.","The incident happened on September 19, but the body camera footage was only just released. It shows Officer Daniel Cardenas, an Eagle Point officer for two years, follow Graves because he allegedly crossed the road outside of a crosswalk.","According to Eagle Point District Attorney Beth Heckert, officer Cardenas followed Graves to the fast-food restaurant because he intended to talk to Graves about the dangers of jaywalking. Instead of informing Graves of anything, however, Cardenas walked into the Carl’s Jr. and pulled his gun on the diagnosed schizophrenic causing him to panic.",Vickie Graves explained at the time that her son was “not on drugs and did not have a weapon” during the incident. She addressed his mental illness: “he talked to himself frequently as he was a schizophrenic. A functioning one.”,"As TFTP has reported on numerous occasions, police reactions to schizophrenics often lead to their deaths as police only know how to yell and escalate violence, two things which are known triggers for the mentally ill.",As Oregon Live reports:,It was later determined Graves was unarmed and had no active warrants. Graves’ father told jurors his son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and hadn’t been taking medication for years.,"The officers testified that Cardenas used a Taser on Graves after Graves put his hands on him, that the stun gun had little effect, that Graves punched Davis soon after he got into the bathroom, and that Graves managed to Tase Davis with Cardenas’ unholstered Taser. They also said that Davis told Cardenas twice that Graves had a gun and that Cardenas shot Graves twice in the back.","The officers later realized Davis mistook the Taser for a gun. The officers’ Tasers and firearms were both black and could have been easily confused in the chaos, Heckert said. Grand jurors suggested officers’ Tasers and firearms be different colors, and Police Chief Darin May said Wednesday that it would be something he would look into.","As the disturbing video below shows, Cardenas was the instigator and Graves merely wanted to get a bite to eat. Graves was simply washing his hands when the officer barged into the bathroom with the gun drawn—over jaywalking.","Within seconds, Graves was in panic mode as Cardenas shot him with the taser for trying to exit the bathroom. Moments later, the two were on the ground as Officer Clarence “C.J.” Davis arrived to help Cardenas. As the two officers held him down, we hear “he has a gun,” before two shots ring out.","He had no such gun. After shooting Graves, the officers realize that fact. When Cardenas asked where the gun Davis mentioned earlier was, Davis said that the officer’s taser on the ground could’ve been what he saw.","For walking across the street, an unarmed and arguably innocent man was killed in a bathroom by public servants, and the system calls this justice—a tragedy indeed.","“I will miss you my dear boy. I see you everywhere I go,” Vickie Graves wrote in a heartbreaking Facebook post after her son’s death. “My heart cries for you. We will always love and miss you. We will find out the reason why you were killed. Our lives will never be the same.”","Sadly, she now knows her son was killed for no reason at all.",,"

"A cop in California forgot his oath to the constitution and confronted a reporter telling him that he needed ""his permission"" to film. He was wrong. ","Anaheim, CA — An Anaheim police officer is receiving media coverage this week for his utter failure at the oath he took to uphold the constitution. Clearly forgetting that all Americans have the right to record in public, officer Michael R. Lozeau confronted a reporter for the Voice of OC for practicing his First Amendment right.","According to the reporter, Spencer Custodio, he was in Maxwell Park to report on the recent enforcement sweeps against homeless people in the area when he witnessed Lozeau detaining three people.",When Custodio recognized one of the homeless men as Les Greenberg he began doing his job as a reporter. As he began snapping pictures from a distance—not interfering with the officer in the least—Lozeau proceeded to break his oath to the constitution.,"“Hey, uh, want to ask my permission?” Lozeau said.","“I’m a reporter – Voice of OC,” Custodio replied.","“I don’t care who you are,” the sergeant replied. “Have a common respect, and ask my permission if you wanna take my picture.”","“Well, may I take your picture?” Custodio asked.","“No,” said the sergeant.","“It’s a First Amendment right, sir,” said Custodio.","“Yeah it is – okay. That’s good,” Lozeau said.","“Okay,” Custodio replied.","“Wanna play that game, huh?” the sergeant asked.","“I’m not trying to play games,” Custodio replied.","“Keep an eye – stay where I can see you, alright? Or leave,” Lozeau said.","“Okay,” Custodio said.",“You understand?” asked Lozeau.,"“You got it,” Custodio replied.","Filming the police is entirely legal in every state. However, all too often, we will see police officers overstep their authority and arrest, attack, and assault innocent people for the constitutionally protected act of documenting their behavior in public.","As TFTP has reported, it has been clearly established that all Americans have the right to record the police. For an officer of the law to remain willingly ignorant of this precedent is at best, dereliction of duty, and at worst, unlawful deprivation of rights. Either way, this cop was in the wrong.","As the ACLU points out,","Taking photographs and video of things that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right—and that includes transportation facilities, the outside of federal buildings, and police and other government officials carrying out their duties.","Unfortunately, law enforcement officers have been known to ask people to stop taking photographs of public places. Those who fail to comply have sometimes been harassed, detained, and arrested. Other people have ended up in FBI databases for taking innocuous photographs of public places.","The right of citizens to record the police is a critical check and balance. It creates an independent record of what took place in a particular incident, one that is free from accusations of bias, lying, or faulty memory. It is no accident that some of the most high-profile cases of police misconduct have involved video and audio records.",VOC called the Anaheim police department after the incident who noted that it is indeed legal for Custodio as well as any other person to film police in public.,"According to the VOC, the Anaheim Police Department’s spokesman, Sgt. Daren Wayatt, said “courts have repeatedly ruled that police officers can be filmed in their duties,” unless it’s interfering with their duties.","“Generally if you’re out of their way and not interfering with them, it should be okay,” Wyatt said.","However, Wyatt then went on to defend his officer for telling the reporter he needed his permission to film him.","Wyatt said he spoke with Lozeau, and his story “is a lot different.”","“He did say that they were out on a car stop, that a person he didn’t know” started taking photos, Wyatt said.","“And [Lozeau] made a comment that, ‘Hey are you going to ask my permission before you take my [picture]?”","“He never told him he couldn’t take pictures. Never told him he couldn’t take pictures of [officers]. And I understand [the reporter] may have taken it as flippant, but [Lozeau] felt the reporter…rolled up on them unannounced, didn’t tell him who he was, what his purpose was,” Wyatt said.","“It probably would have gone a lot different if Spencer identified himself” and explained he was working on a story, Wyatt said.","To reiterate, there is no language in the constitution that requires anyone to ask for permission or identify yourself as a reporter before practicing your rights. Indeed, freedom of press and speech applies to all citizens—not just reporters.","What’s more, according to VOC, Lozeau has a history of going after people who film him. Last year, homeless activist Lou Noble filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Anaheim alleging Lozeau illegally arrested the activist for filming him at Maxwell Park in 2015, the VOC reported..","This flagrant violation of citizens’ rights should be exposed every time it happens. If these officers are not called out for their failure to maintain their oath to the constitution, it will continue to get worse—until one day, when cops arresting people for filming becomes the norm.","

"Fairfax County, Virginia – Earlier this year, Dash Cam footage was released that shows police shooting and killing an unarmed man they claimed was responsible for a hit-and-run. However, the man was actually the victim of a traffic accident and the video shows that he then became the victim of murder by police. After being tight lipped for nearly a year on the incident, the police report has finally been released, showing that the victim was unarmed. Now, the taxpayers could be held liable to the tune of $25 million.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","Bijan Ghaisar, 25, died 10 days after he was shot in the head four times by U.S. Park Police, according to the family.","The Free Thought Project reported on the fact that no gun was found in the original investigation, but Ghaisar family’s lawyers released police reports Monday provided by Fairfax County, including a report confirming Ghaisar was unarmed. This report did not come out until investigators literally scanned every inch of the scene with metal detectors in an attempt to justify the shooting.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","The incident began on Nov. 17, 2017, when Ghaisar was rear-ended by an Uber driver, and although he was the victim of the accident, he left the scene.","The accident was reported to the Fairfax Country Police and they treated it as a suspected “hit-and-run.” The McLean Patch reported that when police located Ghaisar’s car, they attempted to pull it over twice and “both times two officers appeared to approach Ghaisar’s car with weapons drawn before he drove away.”","While police have attempted to paint this situation as one in which officers were chasing a dangerous suspect who was putting their lives at risk by evading their attempts to arrest him, Ghaisar’s family told a very different story.","“Bijan Ghaisar was repeatedly threatened by over-aggressive and out-of-control law enforcement officers after he drove away from a minor traffic incident in which he was the victim and in which there was little property damage and no known injuries,” the family told NBC Washington in a statement.","While an armed Park Police officer can be seen banging on the window of Ghaisar’s car, it is also not clear what directions the officers were giving him at the time.","However, it is clear that the officers were becoming increasingly frustrated with Ghaisar. He continued to drive away and was followed by both Fairfax County and U.S. Park Police officers. When Ghaisar stopped at a stop sign, a police cruiser pulled in front of his car to block it, and two officers approached him with guns drawn.","As Ghaisar’s vehicle began to move forward once again, two of the U.S. Park Police officers fired nine shots into his vehicle—four of which struck him in the head. Ghaisar was taken to the hospital where doctors determined that he had suffered severe brain damage, and he was pronounced dead 10 days later.","At the time, Fairfax County Police Chief Ed Roessler released a statement announcing that the FBI is currently investigating the shooting, and the dash cam footage was released to increase transparency.","“As a matter of transparency to all in our community, especially the Ghaisar family, and as the administrative custodian of the video, I am releasing the in-car video of the U.S. Park Police shooting,” Roessler said. “The video does not provide all the answers. However, we should all have confidence in the FBI’s investigation of this matter as I know it will be thorough, objective and professional.”","Once the FBI took over the case, however, no other information was released and authorities have refused to comment.","The McLean Patch noted that “Park Police wouldn’t comment on why there was a pursuit for a car that had been rear-ended in the first place,” and that after reviewing the evidence, a lawyer told the Ghaisar family that “it is even more clear that the killing of Bijan Ghaisar was completely unnecessary” given the original crash.","Bijan Ghaisar was an accountant, a resident of McLean, and he graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University.",The two U.S. Park Police officers who are responsible for the shooting have since gone back to work after a brief paid vacation and no word of any discipline has been released.,Watch the dash cam footage from the shooting:,,"

"A heartbroken family is demanding to know why their loved one mysteriously died in police custody, and why several of his organs have been seized.","York County, PA – Everett Palmer Jr. was a United States Army Veteran and a father of two before he died mysteriously in police custody earlier this year. Now, the local coroner is claiming that the cause of death is still undetermined, and Palmer’s family is demanding to know what happened and why several of his organs were taken without notice.","The family was not notified that the 41-year-old dad was in critical condition, and it was not until they were being informed of his death that they found out he had been spent the last two days of his life in jail, according to a report from the York Dispatch.","Palmer was initially charged with driving under the influence, careless driving and failing to stay in his own lane after he was responsible for a single car crash in October 2016. Even though he was the only one who was harmed, he was left with a long list of fines and fees, and when he failed to appear in court, a warrant was issued for his arrest.","Palmer turned himself into the police on April 7, and just two days later, he was pronounced dead. The details of what happened over the course of those two days are still disturbingly scarce. Staff at the York County Prison claim that they found Palmer “hitting his heard against his cell door” at 4:20 a.m. on April 9.","The prison guards took Palmer to the in-house medical clinic where he was physically restrained for the next hour, and he apparently became unresponsive. He was then moved to the York Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m.","Now the question remains as to what happened to Palmer between the time he was removed from his cell and the time he took his last breath. While York County Coroner Pam Gay did not say how Palmer was restrained, she did say, “sometimes they have to use physical restraint to render assistance to people … especially if they are self-harming.”","However, Gay also said that the cause of death in police custody is still undetermined—therefore Palmer did not die because he was reportedly hitting his head on the door of his cell, or because he did anything to harm himself. ","“That doesn’t mean (the manner) can’t be changed if more evidence (is found),” Gay said. “We definitely have some clear causes for his death; we just don’t know how some of them happened.”","The coroner claimed Palmer’s death was a result of “complications following an excited state, associated with methamphetamine toxicity, during physical restraint.” Gay said a “high level of methamphetamine” was detected in Palmer’s system.","The claim is notable because Palmer voluntarily turned himself in two days before and he was fine. So if he did have a high level of meth in his system, how did he gain access to it, and when?","Surveillance footage of the final hours before Palmer’s death has yet to be released, and Palmer’s family claims that they have yet to be informed of the manner in which Palmer was “physically restrained” before his death.","The family has attempted to hire a forensic pathologist in order to conduct an additional investigation, but they claimed that Palmer’s organs were needed—and they have mysteriously disappeared. According to a report from the York Daily Record, the family “questioned how some of Everett’s organs, including his brain and heart, were removed without notification and were not yet returned.”","A number of questions remain surrounding the tragic death of Everett Palmer Jr. and the fact that even as months have passed, law enforcement in York County have failed to release pertinent information, raises a new list of inquiries as to what caused Palmer’s death, who was involved, and why the county has gone out of its way to protect the employees who could be responsible.","Marlon Kirton, an attorney for the family, told the York Dispatch that Palmer’s family is seeking justice and demands to know what caused his death and how staff members at the York County Prison played a role.","“We still don’t know why he died! The family will press on to have an autopsy performed,” Kirton said. “We will press on with our civil remedies. … There is nothing today that changes our view that an unarmed Veteran and father of 2 died at the hands of law enforcement.”","

A judge has refused to dismiss excessive force claims against police after multiple officers were seen on video surrounding a man in a restraint chair and hitting him with pepper spray in his face.,"Cincinnati, OH — A federal judge this week refused to dismiss excessive-force claims against Montgomery County, Ohio, and a jail officer who was seen on video torturing a man pepper spray who was suspected drunk driving and strapped in a restraint chair.","When pepper spray was invented, it was, in the words of one of its creators, to be “used to avoid confrontation or injury.” But in the hands of so-called law enforcement, it is increasingly being used as a device of torture, especially when the subject getting pepper sprayed is already in four-point restraints to a chair.","Increasingly, it seems, law enforcement feels it is within their rights to pepper spray individuals who are already restrained. But one victim of apparent police brutality isn’t taking the abuse sitting down. Charles Wade, a resident of Montgomery County, in Dayton Ohio, was arrested in October 2016, on drunk driving charges.","From the video taken in the Montgomery County jail cell, it was clear Mr. Wade was disturbed. He was beating his head against a cinder block wall, then a padded wall, until officers, for his own safety, decided to place him in a restraint chair.","Wade was compliant, offering up no resistance to officers. But did warn them he’d consult with a lawyer if they attempted to cause him pain. Even after being placed in the chair, and having his hands cuffed behind his back, he made what some would have considered a legitimate claim. He said being restrained in the chair, while having his hands cuffed behind his back, amounted to “cruel and unusual punishment” the definition of torture.","Officers then attempted to remove the cuffs, freeing his hands, and allowing his arms to be strapped to the chair. It’s hard to imagine any real consensus would think it improper to restrain such a man, who had already demonstrated a propensity for self-harm. But what happens next, in the eyes of many, amounted to torture.","Officers know all they have to do to get a suspect to react physically, is to use the handcuffs to put pressure on hand bones, and the wrists. When that happens, an inmate will likely move, giving the appearance of someone who is resisting arrest. That may have happened in Wade’s case, because as he was being released from his cuffs, officers strengthened their hold on Wade, even placing his head between his knees. Then, while holding him there, officers discharged pepper spray into his face. Immediately, Wade began asking for help and saying, “I can’t breathe.”","According to court documents, as Wade was being wheeled away, another inmate began banging on his cell door in protest about the treatment that he just witnessed. In response, the defendant, officer Eversole can be heard on the video yelling a threat back to the inmate: “You’re next…..you keep it up…..you are next!”",,"Maybe Americans are becoming desensitized to the act. Maybe it’s because we see unruly inmates on reality TV shows being belligerent and crude. But when inmates are tased and pepper sprayed while being in chair restraints, it’s conceivable to conclude the majority would consider it flat out torture.","Wade’s attorney agrees. Douglas Brannon, his attorney, is also the attorney for Amber Swink, who was also pepper sprayed in 2015 in the same Montgomery County jail while being fully restrained to a chair.","In that video, Sgt. Judith Sealy can be seen approaching Swink in her cell, and then deploying the orange colored pepper spray. Swink struggles for air, gasping, and writhing until it appears as though she passes out. Swink claims the event has traumatized her, creating in her a fear of the police which she did not have prior to the incident.",,"According to the Washington Post, which also covered the two stories of alleged torture by Montgomery County Ohio Jail personnel, pepper spray was never intended to be used as an offensive weapon on restrained individuals. “‘You cannot find any training manual that will tell you it is allowable to pepper-spray somebody who is restrained,’ said Kamran Loghman, a U.S. Naval Academy professor,” who reportedly helped invent pepper spray.","However, a simple YouTube search of “pepper spray” and “restraint chair” keywords produces a disturbing number of videos of suspects, inmates, and prisoners being pepper sprayed while at the same time posing no risk to jail personnel, because they’re already completely subdued.",We spoke with a retired jailer from Massachusetts who said she knew she had to get out of the industrial prison complex industry after she witnessed one prison guard and three police officers tase a man’s genitals while being fully restrained to a restraint chair. She said she knew those officers had “lost their humanity” and were treating inmates in a degrading and torturous manner.,"Brannon told reporters, “I think it happened again because there was no discipline handed out to officers involved in abusing Amber Swink.” He said, “I think this type of treatment is becoming something that happens with impunity within the Montgomery County jail. Certainly, there were four large corrections officers — in addition to a sergeant — who were with Charles Wade and who had sufficient control over him and the situation without resorting to excess uses of force, including the pepper spray.”","As TFTP has reported on numerous occasions, while it is common for police to conduct their own internal investigations into allegations of abuse, more often than not, the individuals implicated in the abuse are never charged with a crime. If charges are filed, they most often get dropped. Very few officers ever spend one day in jail, getting vacation time docked instead of facing criminal charges and real jail time. Swink and Wade, with the help of their attorney Mr. Brannon, have both filed lawsuits against the jail and its employees, alleging they were the victims of torture. And now, the taxpayers, not the cops, will be held accountable.","

"A state lawmaker was caught driving more than 40 mph over the speed limit, and he was not arrested, even after bragging that he normally drives 140 mph.","If there are any questions as to whether there is a legal double standard at work for the average citizen and one of impunity for the state lawmaker, this story will dispel all doubt.","Arizona’s 5th District Representative, Paul Mosley, was caught at 4:30 p.m. on March 27, 2018, by a La Paz County Sheriff’s Deputy just north of Parker, allegedly driving 97 mph in a 55 mph speed zone. Since there are no speed limits above 75 mph (on interstates), going 10 mph over is considered “criminal speeding,” and Mosley was going 42 mph over the speed limit.","Mosley, instead of being humble, contrite, and respectful of the serious situation he was facing—which could have included arrest—bragged to the officer that he was going much faster before he got caught and frequently drives well over 100 mph. After telling the officer he was driving 120 mph just before being pulled over, he remarked:","“Yeah, I go 130, 140, 120. I come down I-10, I was going 120 almost, you know, if there was no traffic,” Mosley said.","The officer cautioned the state legislator about the dangers of driving so fast, how he himself will not speed at such a high rate of speed, and how he’s seen way too many accidents to conclude excessive speeding is in any way recommended. Then he let Mosley go without arrest and without a criminal speeding citation. Later, in the police report obtained by Parker Live Online, the officer noted:","I explained the reason for the stop to Mosley and asked if there was any reason he was traveling so fast…I informed Mosley that 97 mph in a 55 mph zone is considered criminal speed. Mosley stated he was just in a hurry to get home to surprise his family in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Mosley also told me that I should just let him go and that I shouldn’t waste anymore of my time dealing with him due to his immunity as a government official.","Shockingly, Mosley was right! According to Arizona State Law, legislators in the state are immune from prosecution, during their legislative session, presumably to prevent political opponents from using the police to target lawmakers while they’re supposed to be creating new laws. According to AZ Law:","Members of the legislature shall be privileged from arrest in all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, and they shall not be subject to any civil process during the session of the legislature, nor for fifteen days next before the commencement of each session. (Article IV, part 2, section 6.).",Mosley issued an apology on his Facebook page after the scandalous body camera footage was released to the press. The interaction went viral and the lawmaker was forced to give an account for his reckless driving habits. He wrote:,"I would like to apologize to my colleagues and constituents, as well as law enforcement, for my conduct on March 27th, 2018, which is shown in the recently-released video. My desire to get home to see my family does not justify how fast I was speeding nor my reference to legislative immunity when being pulled over. Legislative immunity is a serious responsibility and should not be taken lightly or abused. In addition, my jokes about frequently driving over 100 miles per hour during my 3-hour commute to and from the capitol were entirely inappropriate and showed extremely bad judgement on my part, for which I am truly sorry. I have no excuse for any of this, only regret of my actions, a hope for forgiveness and a commitment that it will not happen again.",https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NfVxZE_OV88,Ask anyone who has lived in Arizona for any length of time and they will tell you—especially if they are from a lower socioeconomic class—that there is one set of laws for citizens and quite another for those in political power.,"Take, for instance, the following case of criminal speeding, also in Arizona. Marc LeBeau was pulled over by an Arizona State Trooper in July 2016 for criminal speeding. We interviewed LeBeau shortly after the incident and he recounted the horror he experienced.","LeBeau said he was asked to get out of the car but he was driving barefoot. LeBeau kindly asked the officer if he could retrieve his sandals and was told “No” by the officer. Because the pavement was 160 degrees, LeBeau started to dance around to avoid the pain experienced in his feet. The officer then escalated the situation by taking LeBeau to the pavement.","A bystander recorded what happened next. LeBeau started screaming in pain, writhing even, begging the officer to take him to the sidewalk or the “rocks.” The video then shows the officer laying on top of him to talk some sense into him, so to speak. But the officer had to have known what he was doing. It would have been impossible for him to have not known how hot the pavement was on that summer day in a state that sees temperatures regularly exceeding 120 degrees in July.","A motorist stopped to aid the officer in handcuffing LeBeau but the damage was done. LeBeau suffered third-degree burns over many parts of his body, all for, as he says, getting mouthy with the police.",,You have to have been born in a barn somewhere not to see the blatant hypocrisy in the way different social classes are treated in Arizona. Here are LeBeau’s injuries. You decide which person got the sweetheart deal.,,"

"Galveston, TX — Isaac Walton, father of three, is fighting for his life in a battle against leukemia. Now, however, he is also fighting police after he says he was attacked by multiple officers, beaten, tasered, and then dumped at a hospital for no reason.","“They abused their authority, pretty much. Thinking they can do what they want with people,” said Walton, who says cops had no reason to even approach him that day.",The incident happened on August 15 as Walton and his family were staying at a hotel in Galveston to celebrate his daughter’s birthday. Walton left the hotel that morning to go get the family breakfast and he says he stopped briefly at the sea wall to take a stroll.,"“Next thing I know, I felt somebody grab me, and I grab my right arm, and this time I realize it’s a police officer,” said Walton. “Immediately I say, ‘Sir, I have a PICC line on this side, and I have leukemia,’ and they didn’t listen to anything I have to say.”","A PICC line, for those who may be unfamiliar, is a catheter implanted in a cancer patient’s arm which is used to administer the chemotherapy drugs.","According to Walton, one officer grabbed him and began beating him while another tasered him. He was then thrown in the back of the squad car.","“The only thing I can think about was trying to get out of that situation safely, without pretty much dying,” Walton said.","“They beat him, they put handcuffs on him, throw him in the back of a car, they don’t charge him with anything, they tell him he’s not under arrest, then they drop him off at an emergency room, and they just leave them there,” said Joe Mathew, an attorney representing Walton said.","After being dumped at the hospital, Walton finally made it back to the hotel where his family found him slumped over in pain. They immediately drove him to MD Anderson Cancer Center where his wife took photos of his injuries and they contacted the University of Texas Police Department who filed an incident report.","Despite not charging Walton with a crime at the time, days later, he’d be charged with resisting arrest — a move Walton says is an attempt to cover up for the officers’ criminal behavior.","“The only ones who should be charged in this incident, are the police officers who did this to him,” Walton’s attorney said.","In response to why they waited several days to issue a warrant for resisting arrest, the police released the following statement:","On Wednesday, August 15th 2018, at approximately 9:57am, the Galveston Police Department received two 911 calls requesting that the police check the welfare of a male, later identified as, 32-year-old Isaac Walton, as he was out on a jetty in the 3000 block of Seawall Blvd. During their encounter with Walton, he refused to follow commands given by Officers to further their investigation and was subsequently arrested for Resisting Arrest and transported him to the Galveston County Jail where jail medical staff refused to accept Walton until he was declared fit for incarceration by an attending doctor. Officers subsequently transported Walton to UTMB and released him, and requested a warrant for his arrest be issued for the aforementioned charge.","The warrant request for the charge of Resisting Arrest, Search, or Transport was completed by the officer on August 15th and was submitted to the court the next morning on Thursday, August 16th. The Galveston Police Department was made aware of the allegations against the officers later that evening, at which point the Chief of Police initiated an investigation into the officers’ conduct. The judge subsequently signed and issued the warrant the following Monday, August 20th at which point the warrant became active and was entered into the state and national registry. Walton was then detained by League City Police during a traffic stop on September 7th, arrested for the active warrant, and transported to the Galveston County Jail.
The internal investigation has since revealed that the involved officers’ actions did not appear to violate policy. To date, Walton has not filed an official complaint with the Galveston Police Department.","It appears that there are some questions concerning the timeline of events due to the gap between the warrant being filed, and the arrest. Hopefully this explains the sequence and answers those questions. Since the criminal case is still pending we are not able to comment on the details of the criminal case.","Walton, who is still battling leukemia, says that police fabricated this story to cover up what they did to him.","Even if police were responding to a welfare check request, Walton had harmed no one. How is it somehow considered okay for cops to walk up to an innocent man, begin demanding that he obey their every command, and then beat the hell out of him for not doing so fast enough?",Walton’s family also has a GoFundMe site to help with some of the medical bills.,,Walton is now another victim of a system who arrests people for resisting arrest. ,"

A video has gone viral after it showed Ohio cops give a man a UFC-style beat down as he simply stood in a friend's front yard and talked.,"Akron, OH — A video of several officers arresting an Ohio man has gone viral as it shows police officers on top of 47-year-old Patrick King, tasering him and punching him over and over. According to King the stop should have never happened as he was simply walking back from the neighborhood store and stopped to talk to a friend.","On Sunday, King told News 5 Cleveland that he was confronted by Akron police officers while he stood in a friend’s front yard and talked.","“Basically pulled up alongside of me, jumped out and asked me for my ID,” King said.","“They wanted to handcuff me and I didn’t want to be handcuffed and I said, ‘What for? What for?’ And, they got one handcuff on me and then threw me to the ground,” he said.","King admitted that he gave officers a fake name, but insisted that he didn’t do anything wrong. However, that didn’t stop officers from violently attacking him.","“They started beating on me, wailing on me, kicked me in the ribs several times,” King said.",King said he’s injured from the attack and has a hard time moving around.,“I can barely sit still right now. I’m having trouble just raising my spine.”,"As the video shows, officers begin struggling with King who is simply getting kidnapped for no other reason than wanting to be left alone. Other than giving cops a fake name, presumably because he didn’t want them to know who he was, King had harmed no one.",Police only stopped him because they claim he was seen leaving a “known drug house.”,"When the local news company asked King if he thought it was excessive force, he minced no words, saying, “Yes, I do. I’m just waiting to get a hold of a lawyer and I plan on suing.”","According to Akron police, however, they say the video doesn’t tell the whole story and King presented a danger to the officers.","Deputy Chief Jesse Leeser said King was “spotted leaving a known drug house and lied about who he was. An officer got one handcuff on the 6-foot-4-inch, 220-pound man, but he ignored multiple commands and resisted for several minutes.”","Leeser said the dozens of punches, taser strikes, kicks and knees were all necessary to subdue King. However, as TFTP has reported, it is nearly impossible to listen to officers’ commands to “stop resisting” and lay perfectly still as they taser, punch, and kick you.","“He was obviously actively fighting with these officers. They were winded. The fight had gone to the ground. Not only did he have the handcuff as a weapon possibly, but the officers were also very exposed. We’re not ground fighters,” Leeser said.",At least one of the officers appeared to be a ground fighter though. That officer is seen delivering countless punches to King in a UFC-style ‘ground and pound.’,"As for King, he denied leaving the drug house and said he never attacked officers during the arrest.","“I didn’t swing at the officers. I know that. I didn’t punch at them. I know that. I didn’t kick at them. I know that,” he said.","According to News 5 Cleveland, King said he served six years in the Army. During his service, he was involved in an Army vehicle accident in Panama and was pinned in the back seat. He said the incident left him with post-traumatic stress syndrome.","He said that feeling of being pinned rushed back to him when he was on the ground with police, which put him a panic mode.","“The Tasers came out. Everything was happening so fast. As far as me flailing and wailing around, yeah, that was a combination of the electricity going through my body and the PTSD.”","Police said King also had two active warrants, one out of Cuyahoga County for a probation violation and another for obstructing out of New Franklin.","King told News 5 the Cuyahoga County warrant related to walking away from a court-ordered veteran’s treatment center, a decision he regrets.","He said he had prior run-ins with the law for not paying child support and drug possession, but he doesn’t feel his past justifies the actions of Akron police on Sunday.","“I hope you never get in that situation, but it seems like it’s become more and more of a police state,” King told WEWS.",,,"

A judge handed down a seemingly unprecedented 15-year sentence to a Georgia cop who perpetuated a fake war on cop by falsely claiming she'd been shot. ,"Jackson, GA — In September of 2016, police around the country spread the story and asked for prayers for one of their own who’d been shot while on duty. An investigation was launched, a dragnet conducted, the town locked down and a suspect had been brought in. However, cops and their supporters quickly found out they had been duped by their fellow officer once investigators discovered the entire story had been fabricated. This week, former Jackson Police Department Officer Sherry Hall was sentenced to prison for her lies.","In an unprecedented sentence, Superior Court Judge Thomas Wilson made Hall, 43, pay for her crimes. He gave her 15 years in prison followed by another 23 years on probation.","“It was dumbfounding that she went to trial,” District Attorney James Moss said. “She never took responsibility. She invented out of whole cloth a black man who shot her, and if law enforcement hadn’t done their jobs right, we could have had a gentleman wrongly charged with a crime.”","Her story, which sounds like a kindergartner made it up, went something like this — while on patrol, Hall saw a man sitting on the roadside and decided to approach him. As she approached, the man became argumentative, shot her in the stomach, and fled. As the non-existent suspect, described by Hall as ‘a 5’8″ to 6′ black male weighing about 200 pounds,’ ran away, Hall fired twice.","Immediately after the fake shooting, news outlets across the country ran with the narrative that a cop had been shot and the suspect was still at large.","During a press conference after the shooting, Chief James Morgan with the Jackson Police Department, called Hall, a four-year law enforcement veteran, the ultimate professional.","“She’s highly trained and gives it her all,” Morgan said. “She’s a very good officer and a very good person.”",He was then forced to eat those words.,"“She did a great job for us, up until that night,” Morgan said. “So we didn’t see this coming. But this was not a mistake. It was a conscious decision and a choreographed act.”","Because an outside agency, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), conducted the investigation, and not the Jackson Police Department, inconsistencies were found and actually examined.","Peaking their interests was the fact that Hall indicated she’d turned off all video and audio recording equipment prior to ‘being shot.’ This led to the GBI looking at evidence from the hard drive of the in-car camera system, as well as engaging the assistance of a GBI Digital Forensic Investigator in an effort to recover additional evidence, according to 11 Alive.","Inconsistencies were uncovered in relation to Hall’s story, which led to the conclusion that she was, in fact, not the victim of a shooting. ","In an effort to reconcile the inconsistencies, the GBI conducted a subsequent interview of Hall, and during that interview she stopped cooperating with the investigation.","Further investigation determined that Hall failed to reveal to the GBI that she was in possession of an additional department handgun issued to her on July 1, 2016. After a search warrant was issued for her Butts County residence, the weapon was seized.","In October of 2016, Hall surrendered and was booked into the Butts County Detention Facility. She was charged with making False Statements, Tampering with Evidence, Interference with Government Property and Violation of Oath of Office. She is now serving her time at Arrendale State Prison in Alto.","Hall’s fake shooting story is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident. In fact, several other officers have been caught forwarding the false narrative about the war on cops with fake shootings — one cop went to the ultimate extreme.","In September 2015, a massive manhunt ensued after Lt. Joe Gliniewicz was found dead 50 yards from his cruiser 15 minutes after he radioed in that he was pursuing three suspects on foot. Despite locking down the entire town, no suspects were found in the area.","The following November, it was revealed that the reason no suspects were ever found was due to the fact that Gliniewicz killed himself. In a press conference, Lake County Major Crimes Task Force commander George Filenko said, “This staged suicide was the end result of extensive criminal acts that Gliniewicz had been committing.”","Gliniewicz wasn’t alone either. Also in September 2015, a Millis, MA police department placed an entire town on lockdown after a cop claimed he’d been shot by a ‘black man.’ However, it was quickly discovered that the cop faked being shot at to cover for his reckless driving.","“We have determined that the officer’s story was fabricated. Specifically, that he fired shots at his own cruiser as a plan to concoct a story that he was fired upon,” Millis Police Sgt. William Dwyer said. “The evidence indicates the shots were not fired by a suspect, and there is no gunman at large in or around the town.”","

"While the sheriff admitted that raping a woman on the side of the road is not standard protocol, he defended the two officers who got away with it.","Houston – The account of a woman who was raped by police on the side of the road after a traffic stop turned into a horrific public “cavity search,” because officers claimed they “smelled marijuana” in 2015, has finally gained enough attention for the local sheriff to issue a response.","Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez released a statement on Facebook, which reminded the public of the department’s perspective on the incident when it referred to the victim of the horrendous treatment as “a female suspect” in the first sentence.","However, it should be noted that when Charnesia Corley, a 21-year-old African American college student with no criminal history, was first stopped, the only thing she was suspected of doing was allegedly running a stop sign.","“I understand and respect the community’s concerns regarding the parking lot search of a female suspect during a June 2015 traffic stop. I want to be emphatically clear that today’s Harris County Sheriff’s Office is fully committed to ensuring that every resident of our community is treated with dignity and respect, even if they are suspected of committing a crime. We hold the public’s trust as sacred, and we will always strive to be worth of that trust.”","Within minutes after the traffic stop began in June 2015, Harris County Deputies William Strong and Ronaldine Pierre claimed that they “smelled marijuana” on Corley, which somehow served as justification for their decision to strip off her clothes in public, force her to lay on the side of the road with her ankles in the air, and to spend over 10 minutes raping her—or as they called it, performing a “vaginal cavity search”—all because they claimed that they smelled a hint of an illegal plant. They found nothing.",,"The statement from Sheriff Gonzalez did not directly acknowledge that the actions of Strong and Pierre were wrong and vile, but he did say that the department’s policy requires officers to obtain a warrant before conducting a strip search, and when that warrant is obtained, the search must be conducted in a designated facility.","“Harris County Sheriff’s Office policy prohibits deputies from conducting strip searches without a warrant. In cases in which a warrant is obtained, strip searches may be conducted in a private, sanitary and appropriate facility.”","Despite the fact that none of the standard procedures listed by Gonzalez were followed by either one of the deputies on the scene, neither of those officers were charged, or even fired for their illegal actions.","As The Free Thought Project reported, while Strong and Pierre were initially charged with official oppression and indicted by a grand jury, their charges mysteriously disappeared before they had the chance to go to trial, after the District Attorney’s office took their charges to a second grand jury where they were dismissed earlier this month.","“They were already indicted and set for trial under the old administration and the new administration no bills them, finds a grand jury that will no bill them and they claim it’s based on new evidence,” Sam Cammack, Corley’s attorney said regarding the sudden change.","The statement from Sheriff Gonzalez confirmed that not only are Strong and Pierre not facing criminal charges, they have both returned to work in some capacity for the Harris County Sheriff’s Department, and their salaries are still being paid by the taxpayers.","“Criminal charges are no longer pending against two of the deputies involved in this case. Deputy W. Strong, who did not actively participate in the search of the subject in this case will be allowed to return to patrol duties. Deputy R. Pierre, who initiated the search, will remain in her current assignment within the Communications and Technology Bureau.”","Over 200 individuals commented on the Facebook post, the majority of which were quick to call out the Harris County Sherriff’s Department for its inability to hold its officers accountable. Several noted that while the department refers to the officers’ actions as simply a “cavity search,” they should start calling it what it is: sexual assault.","“Someone should lose their job at a minimum and criminal charges should be pressed against all of the officers involved. This was a crime against someone’s child,” one woman commented.",“You and your department screwed up. These types of actions are never permissible in public. Your oath swearing community servants did something that would cause any reasonable person to go completely berserk and this statement is the best you can do?” one man wrote. ,"Gonzalez also confirmed that “this incident is the subject of an ongoing civil lawsuit,” which means that while there is a chance Charnesia Corley could receive financial compensation for the horrific treatment she endured, it will come at the hands of the taxpayers, and it is not guaranteed that William Strong or Ronaldine Pierre will be held accountable for their actions.",*The following dash cam footage of the incident contains graphic content*,,"

"For building a mailbox library on their own property to encourage children to read, a family was visited by the police and told to remove it. ","Point Pleasant, NJ — We can now add giving away free books as a reason police will show up to your home and threaten you with fines. Earlier this month, that is exactly what happened to a New Jersey family when they built a “Mailbox Library” in their front yard to encourage the neighborhood children to read.",The Hagemeyer family had just finished construction of their new library — which was already being used by children in the neighborhood — when police showed up at their door telling them it needed to be removed.,"“We’re still shaking our heads over the whole thing,” Grace Hagemeyer told Patch.","As Patch reports,","After getting the call and talking to the family, the police initially said there was nothing they can do about it, according to the family, even though thousands of “mailbox libraries” have been popping up all over the country.","Grace said she and her husband, Peter, put one up on their property and had a grand opening on July 29 at their Hardenbergh Avenue home. That same day, they had a visit from police. The next day, they were contacted by code enforcement officers.",The Hagemeyers then were told they had 10 days to take the structure down off their property. The family was initially told that such libraries are not allowed because they’re not mentioned in the land-use ordinance.,Officials said the police were sent out because a citizen — apparently infatuated with the police state — called police to report that the library was a nuisance.,"“If they get an official complaint, they have to look into it,” Point Pleasant Boro Administrator Frank Pannucci Jr. said.","How, exactly, a structure the size of a mailbox that is designed to encourage children to read, can be a nuisance is a mystery. However, that was the case and the government had to do their job to get rid of it.","“Seriously, does it get any better than that? ” Grace told Patch. “Neighborhood kids walking around carrying books, instead of having their noses buried in their phones.”","“We live in a great town, on a friendly street,” Grace said. “This is the kind of community we should be encouraging.”","Luckily, after the story began to shine a negative light on the city, they reacted by telling the family that they could keep the library, but they just had to move it further back on their property.","Officials then claimed that it was too close to the roadway, a reason that the Hagemeyers say was not originally given. Either way, the library does get to remain, so it is a tiny victory for the family despite the fact that they had to move it behind their fence.","As the Free Thought Project has reported, instances of snitch neighbors calling police on people for doing good deeds, or children trying to make a few bucks by selling lemonade, are becoming a common scenario.","It appears that many Americans are becoming obsessed with calling the cops on their fellow citizens for non-crimes. As this case and the many others illustrate, we are beginning to treat Orwell’s ‘1984’ as an instruction manual.",,"

A Phoenix man was mauled by a police k9 while he was handcuffed and waiting booking inside his jail cell in an apparent act of torture.,"Phoenix, AZ — Attorney Joel Robbins, a Phoenix civil-rights attorney in practice for 25 years, could not believe what police and their K9 did to his client after he was accused of assaulting a police officer, “I’ve never heard of them bringing a dog into a holding cell…It just doesn’t make sense.” Shane McGough and some friends went tubing at the Salt River in 2017. Following a fun day on the river, the friends returned to their vehicle and were involved in a minor traffic accident with an Uber vehicle.","The responding security guards, both off-duty Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies, attempted to search the vehicle belonging to McGough’s friend. McGough objected and reportedly blocked deputy Michael Finney from searching the car which reportedly had a gun laying in the floor board. It’s not illegal to possess a firearm in Arizona and the state has open carry laws allowing guns to be placed anywhere within a vehicle without a crime being committed. Finney escalated the conflict by choking McGough, who was a high school and collegiate wrestler.","An accomplished wrestler, such as McGough, could easily have overpowered both deputies, taken their guns, batons, and tasers from them, and beaten them to a pulp, but there’s no indication from the eyewitness accounts of what happened on scene and the following more controversial encounter at the holding station, the 27-year-old man was anything but compliant.","Choking a wrestler would certainly, and did provoke a response by McGough, who defended himself against an unlawful assault by a police officer. Another officer tackled McGough, and fractured his own leg in the process.","Following the incident the Phoenix New Times’ began investigating. Robbins provided the newspaper with body camera footage of the K9 attack on a handcuffed citizen. In the recording McGough can be heard asking, no less than 30 times, what he did wrong and why he was being arrested. He was handcuffed and escorted from the police squad car and then taken into the holding cell. A U.S. Forestry Service officer then choked McGough, who responded with profanities, again not illegal.","Then, the officers threw the young man on the floor of the jail cell and allowed the police attack dog known as “Shadow” to maul McGough for more than 3 minutes. The attack was all captured on body camera footage.","McGough later plead guilty to assault charges, spent six months in jail, and filed a federal civil rights lawsuit while he was imprisoned.","“When you’re subjecting someone to lengthy and continuous pain and maiming, torture is an appropriate word,” said Steven Guy another attorney representing McGough. The young man who’s now become an apparent victim of brutal police tactics which resemble vengeance, is seeking several million dollars in damages from the unprovoked attack by the police K9 who attacked upon the command of his police handler. McGough is seeking 4 million from MCSO and 2 million from the U.S. Forestry Service for being choked by one of its officers.","Maricopa County’s new sheriff Paul Penzone had an opportunity to distance himself from his predecessor’s brutal regime and reign, but instead he rallied with the thin blue line in comments made about McGough’s case this week. “I’m far more concerned with the injuries that were sustained to my deputy who may not return to this career than the injuries that were sustained by the individual who carried out that violence,” Penzone told reporters.","It’s no secret young people drink on the Salt River while they’re tubing. Not only do they drink, they drink a lot. MCSO routinely stops, conducts DUI checkpoints, and responds to incidents when they happen. But when attack dogs are used to inflict deep puncture wounds on handcuffed individuals, one can expect a lawsuit.","Worse still is the fact the head of such a police department, which would use a dog to hurt someone for defending themselves and their property against an unconstitutional search of one’s vehicle, couldn’t actually care less about the bites the citizen received who he’s sworn to protect and serve.",, ,"

Disturbing body camera footage captures the horrific effects of the US school system continuing to rely on police to handle young children with autism. ,"Denton, TX – (RT) Body cam footage has emerged showing the moment a school resource officer forced a 10-year-old boy with autism to the ground and handcuffed him. The child’s mother says the entire incident amounts to “abuse.”","The video begins by showing the young boy, Thomas, sitting in a cubby by himself in a classroom at Lee Elementary School in Denton, Texas in April. His teacher tries to encourage him to “hop out of the cubby” and eventually takes him by the wrist to help pull him down.","A Denton Police Department school resource officer, who had been called to the room, can then be heard saying “do you want help?” to which the teacher replies that she does.","At that point, the officer picks up Thomas and carries him down the hallway to a room. That room, called the SOAR room, is a space where children can quiet down, according to local news outlet WFAA.","Once they have arrived in the room, the officer places the child on the ground and says “do you want the handcuffs?” Thomas is then cuffed while he screams and the teacher watches from a corner. According to the footage, Thomas was handcuffed three separate times before his mother, Emily Brown, arrived.","It wasn’t until his mother got home with Thomas that she and her husband Robert discovered bruises on their son’s body. At that point, Emily told WFAA that they “started realizing there’s really something wrong here.”","Although police say Thomas was poking other students, the video only shows the child backed into the cubby.","“I see a little boy hiding,” Emily told WFAA. “Not doing anything that’s an imminent serious harm to someone else.” She equated the situation to “abuse,” calling it an unnecessary use of force by the officer.","The Browns told WFAA that the very fact their son was handcuffed was breaking a rule, as they have a detailed intervention plan in place with the school which does not permit the use of restraints. “There are a variety of de-escalation techniques they’re supposed to be using,” the child’s father said.","However, the city of Denton said that, following a departmental review of the incident, “no violations” to laws or policies were found, and that proper protocol was followed. The officer has been allowed to keep his job at the school.",The family is considering taking legal action against the school district and plans to place Thomas in a charter school this year.,"

Police violence during the Jason Stockley protests was so over the top that four cops have been charged with beating one of their own officers. ,"St. Louis, MO — In December 2011, St. Louis Police Officer Jason Stockley violated department policy when he grabbed his personal AK-47, premeditated, and then murdered Anthony Lamar Smith. The planning of the murder and the actual murder were captured on the officer’s dashcam. In spite of the overwhelming amount of evidence against him, a St. Louis judge last year found Stockley not guilty of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Smith. Months of protests ensued immediately.","“Once they put those barricades up, I knew what was up,” activist Jae Shepherd recalled to Rolling Stone. “They put those up when we were waiting for the indictment or non-indictment of Darren Wilson when Mike [Brown] was killed. It was just like this building up of anticipation and anxiety.”","During the protests, angry citizens took to the streets en masse. They were met by hundreds of police officers in riot gear, who were armed with military grade weaponry and technology.","During the protests, story after story surfaced of officers using unnecessary force, beating protesters and making false arrests. This was in spite of the fact that the protests ran relatively smoothly and were far less violent than the ones in 2014 in Ferguson after the killing of Mike Brown.","Despite the peaceful nature of the protests, police officers were seen on video carrying out extremely disturbing acts. One such act involved trampling an elderly woman. Another act involved police chanting “whose streets? Our streets!” as they surrounded protesters—otherwise known as ‘kettling’— and began a brutal assault with pepper spray and police batons.","Police violence had gotten so bad, in fact, that four officers were actually arrested and charged with civil rights violations.","Officers Dustin Boone, Bailey Colletta, Randy Hays and Christopher Myers face federal charges of civil rights violation, obstruction of justice and lying to federal investigators.",These four cops are accused of savagely beating a demonstrator during the protests and then covering it up. But this was no ordinary demonstrator.,"During the protests, undercover police officers were placed throughout the crowd in order to catch people who were attempting to instigate violence or destroy property. Police violence was so over the top, that these four officers allegedly grabbed one of their own, a 22-year veteran of the department who was working undercover.","The officers are accused of attacking their fellow officer without reason, throwing him to the ground, and savagely beating him—causing serious bodily injury.",As the St. Louis Business Journal reports:,"Count one of the indictment specifically alleges that Boone, Hays and Myers violated the undercover officer’s constitutional rights when they used unreasonable force on him. Their actions resulted in bodily injury and included the use of a dangerous weapon. The indictment also alleges they threw the undercover officer to the ground and kicked him while he was compliant and not posing a physical threat to anyone.","Count two charges Boone, Hays and Myers with conspiracy to obstruct justice for conspiring and agreeing to engage in misleading conduct toward witnesses to prevent information about their criminal conduct from reaching federal authorities.","Count three of the indictment also charges Myers with destruction of evidence for knowingly destroying and mutilating the undercover officer’s cell phone with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the investigation into his arrest and assault.","Count four charges Colletta with corruptly attempting to obstruct, influence, and impede federal grand jury proceedings by engaging in a series of misleading assertions and false statements when she testified before the grand jury.","Count one carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Counts two, three, and four each carry maximum penalties of 20 years in prison. All four counts carry a maximum fine of $250,000.","Due to the egregious nature of these officers’ actions and their subsequent indictments, the St. Louis Circuit Attorney has dropped 91 cases with which these officers were involved.","On Thursday, all four of the officers pleaded not guilty to the charges.",All four of the St. Louis Metro Police Officers pled not guilty to the charges against them @FOX2now,"— Katherine Hessel (@KHesselFox2) December 6, 2018",,"All of the officers are currently on administrative leave without pay and are awaiting their future court date which has not yet been released. Hopefully their case plays out different than the one of Jason Stockley and justice is actually served. Because their victim was a police officer, there is a higher chance that will happen.","

"A California cop feared for his life when a child's dog came to the door, so he opened fire and his bullet hit an 11-year-old boy.","San Bernardino, CA — Once again, a cop’s fear of a dog has put others in harm’s way, and, once again, an innocent person was hurt. This time, an 11-year-old boy was struck by a police officer’s bullet when the officer was attempting to kill his dog.","This week, a deputy from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department was responding to a call over a possible disturbance at a home. When the deputy knocked on the door, the 11-year-old boy answered and—like most dogs in the world do when they hear a knock at the door—his pup ran out.","Instead of doing what any postal worker, pizza delivery driver, or UPS driver would do—by solving the situation without a gun—the cop pulled out his service weapon and attempted to kill the boy’s dog. Luckily, for the dog, the cop is a terrible shot. However, the boy was not so lucky.","While the bullet only grazed the dog’s paw, it then hit the little boy.","“The dog sustained a graze wound to a paw and his side,” a statement from the sheriff’s department read. “The bullet then ricocheted off of the cement of the front porch and stucco of the house, and a fragment grazed the 11-year-old boy on the outside of his left leg.”","Naturally, the sheriff’s department claimed that the dog “charged” the officer and he had no other choice but to open fire in the direction of a small child to avoid any potential of getting bit—or licked.","After shooting the boy and the dog, emergency personnel were called to the home and the boy was treated for the bullet wound to his leg.",It was reported that the dog was taken to a nearby veterinarian and will also make a full recovery. The sheriff’s deputy was uninjured.,According to the Daily Press:,Investigators from the Sheriff’s Department Specialized Investigations Division were requested and are conducting the investigation. Officials said updates will be provided as additional information is available for release.,Anyone with information related to this investigation is urged to contact Detective Floyd Stone of the Specialized Investigations Division Homicide Detail at 909-387-3589. Persons wishing to remain anonymous can contact the We-Tip Hotline at 1-800-782-7463 or online at www.wetip.com.,Officials with the sheriff’s department have not said whether or not the deputy who shot the child and the dog has been placed on suspension.,"Sadly, cops shooting at dogs and hitting kids is not an isolated incident.","Earlier this year, a cop was fired after he shot a little girl inside her own home while trying to kill her dog. Showing that they are willing to hold their own accountable, the officer was charged with felony aggravated battery in March.","In January, Officer Dexter Betts was placed on administrative leave after discharging his firearm inside a family’s home—in the cowardly attempt to kill a dog.","Body camera video of the incident showed Betts and his partner approach the house with flashlights and enter through the front door. When they enter the house, several children are seen in the living room watching television.",Betts checks the hallway and then returns to the living room where he becomes frightened by the family’s medium sized English bull terrier named Chevy.,"“Ok, we got a dog inside here, too,” he says. “Whoa! Whoa!”","Then, with careless disregard for the children in the room, Betts puts the lives of multiple innocent people in danger to shoot at a dog who just barked at him.","“Ow! Ow! Ow, you hurt my eye! Ow! Ow!” the girl begins to yell immediately. Her screams are absolutely heartbreaking.","Luckily, the 11-year-old boy, and the girl in the video below both escaped with their lives. Autumn Steele, who was shot and killed by a cop who tried to kill her dog, was not so lucky.",,"

"Instead of being held to a higher standard of justice for betraying the public's trust and preying on a child, a police officer in New Jersey was let off on rape charges without having to spend a single day in jail.","Camden County, NJ — Police, we are told, are society’s finest. Heroic men and women sacrifice themselves to protect society from criminals so that we may live long and safe lives. If this assertion were entirely true, when these fine men and women commit a crime they are sworn to prevent, they should be held to higher standards than the rest of society because not only have they broken a law, but they have betrayed the trust of people they serve.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","However, as the case below illustrates, all too often, when a police officer betrays this trust—going so far as to prey on society’s most vulnerable, children—their badge grants them a lower standard of justice and they escape accountability.","Rafael Martinez Jr., a now-former Camden County cop was found guilty of having sexual relations with and impregnating a child. This was confirmed with DNA evidence and the officer himself admitted it. However, he will not spend a single day in jail.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","As NJ.com reports, Judge Edward McBride accepted a negotiated plea to sentence Martinez to five years probation. As part of the agreement, Martinez pleaded to endangering the welfare of a child.","The New Jersey Age of Consent is 16 years old. In the United States, the age of consent is the minimum age at which an individual is considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity. Individuals aged 15 or younger in New Jersey are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity is defined as statutory rape.","Because Martinez’ victim was only 15 years old, she was not legally able to consent to have sex with the 33-year-old public servant, which makes it an act of rape under New Jersey law.","These facts, however, were of no concern to the justice system in New Jersey as they refused to send him to jail. Instead, this police officer, who betrayed his oath to the constitution, who betrayed the citizens he served, and who took advantage of a child, got off scot free with only five years of probation.",As NJ.com reports:,"In mid-August 2017, the teen gave birth at Cooper University Hospital in Camden and was interviewed by a social worker there, according to court documents.","The girl told the social worker that Martinez, 33, was the father, which was later confirmed with DNA evidence.","According to Deputy First Assistant Prosecutor Grace MacAulay, Martinez’ defense was that he didn’t know the girl was only a child because she told him she was 18.","“Saying the child told me she was 18, that is inexcusable and unacceptable for any person in our society, but especially for a law enforcement officer,” MacAulay said. “They are held to a higher standard.”","Sadly, however, the reference to a “higher standard” was little more than lip service as this former cop’s sentence proves the standards are quite low for law enforcement.","During the closing statements of the sentencing, the judge brought up Martinez’ service as an officer and, in a roundabout way, used it to justify his decision not to send him to jail.","In sentencing Martinez, McBride noted that “his conduct is the result of circumstances that are unlikely to recur” and that the cop had no prior contact with the criminal justice system (besides being part of it).","

An Arkansas sheriff stands accused of forcing inmates to wear a Nike shirt to mock their campaign and exploit inmates to make his political point.,"Last month, Americans got up in arms because Nike chose to put the face of Colin Kaepernick on the front of their ‘Just Do It’ campaign. After the announcement, people took to social media to express their outrage, announce a boycott, and literally light fires. And now, according to photos published to Twitter this week, a sheriff’s department in Arkansas exploited inmates to show his disdain for the shoe company.","On Wednesday evening, activist Shaun King tweeted out a collage of photos he says were given to him by a source from within the Union County Sheriff’s department. They were accompanied by the following description:","The Sheriff in Union County, Arkansas is putting Nike t-shirts on people they arrest and making them wear them during mugshots. Source says it is to mock Nike and Colin Kaepernick. Disgusting.","The Sheriff in Union County, Arkansas is putting Nike t-shirts on people they arrest and making them wear them during mugshots.",Source says it is to mock Nike and Colin Kaepernick. Disgusting. pic.twitter.com/9z9Nw9hxuF,"— Shaun King (@shaunking) October 11, 2018",,King made the claim that the Union County Sheriff Ricky Roberts was forcing inmates to wear the shirts so he could make his political point.,"According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, they reached out to the Roberts Wednesday evening, but was unable to speak with him. Calls to the sheriff’s office were directed to a voicemail for the the public relations officer, Chief Deputy Charles Phillips, who was also unavailable Wednesday night.","The paper did note that at “approximately 9 p.m. Wednesday, less than an hour after King posted the allegation to social media, the Union County Sheriff’s Office removed all photos of inmates from the jail’s online roster.”",The removal of the photos indicates that they realized their gig was up.,"According to the jail’s roster, the black Nike shirts with the large logo on the center began to show up around September 15, less than two weeks after the campaign began.","The sheriff forcing people to wear the Nike shirt as part of some political statement is most assuredly a violation of policy. Moreover, it outright disrespectful to the people in the photos and does absolutely everything to further divide in the country.","The divide and conquer identity politics being pushed on people is coming to a head and people are literally burning things and exploiting people. The talking heads on TV are forcing people to take sides and people are attacking others for doing nothing other than practicing free speech—in a country that was founded on it. This goes both ways too, with the left and the right. However, exploiting people who you have in a jail goes far beyond free speech.","As Rachel Blevins noted last month, while the left applauds Nike for choosing Kaepernick as a spokesperson, and the right argues that Nike should have chosen a former NFL player like Pat Tillman—while completely ignoring the U.S. government’s blatant cover-up of Tillman’s tragic death—they are all completely ignoring the fact that whether they are praising Nike or criticizing Nike, they are still helping the campaign.","Even the people who are taking to social media to brag about burning their Nike merchandise are destroying products that they have already paid Nike for and they are also helping to raise awareness about the campaign. And as The Free Thought Project has reported, the products they are burning could have easily been donated to a good cause:","“After last year’s season ended, this sentiment lay festering in the back of everyone’s minds until this Sunday when Nike made their announcement. Up in arms, supposed “patriots” began calling for the boycott of Nike and destroying their clothing because a kneeling football player is somehow disrespectful to this country. But is kneeling more disrespectful to “the troops” than taking to social media and destroying a pair of shoes that could’ve been donated to a homeless veteran? Is Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the anthem more disrespectful to the troops than calling for his freedom of speech, his constitutional rights that the troops ostensibly fight for, to be removed?","What’s more disrespectful, kneeling to protest people being killed by police or taking to social media to gloat about the fact that you can burn a $100 pair of sneakers while a homeless veteran you claim to “support” goes hungry, walking the streets in laceless boots with holes in them, as his feet bleed from blisters?","Burning goods that could’ve gone to a homeless veteran—whose country chewed him up and spit him out—in protest to someone’s freedom of speech, which that veteran fought for, is not only an insult to the troops, but it highlights just how hypocritical some folks are when they claim to “support the troops.”","Nike’s campaign has now generated more than $163 million in media exposure reaching historical highs, according to reports from Apex Marketing Group.","While Nike will make money from the campaign and Kaepernick will make money from his deal with Nike, the question remains—will anything be done for the families who have lost their loved ones to police violence, and will anything be done to stop similar acts of violence from happening in the future?","

"The 'Coward of Broward' who failed to intervene when Nikolas Cruz murdered 17 people in a Florida high school claims he had ""no legal duty"" to protect the students—and court cases say he's right.","A Florida court was shocked this week when disgraced ex-deputy Scot Peterson aka “The Coward of Broward” claimed in court that he had no legal duty to confront the Parkland shooter and protect the children inside the school. Although the judge rejected the deputy’s claim that he had no duty to confront Nikolas Cruz that day, a pile of court cases says otherwise.",Broward Circuit Judge Patti Englander Henning found after a hearing Wednesday that ex-deputy Scot Peterson did have a duty to protect the students inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on that fateful day in February in which 17 died and 17 others were wounded.,"As TFTP reported, video showed deputy Peterson cowering in fear outside the building as gunfire erupted inside. Had he confronted Cruz, an untold number of lives may have been saved.","The court case against Peterson is a negligence suit filed by Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was tragically killed in the shooting. Pollack said that it made no sense for the deputy to argue that he had no legal duty to go inside.","“Then what is he doing there?” Pollack said after the ruling. “He had a duty. I’m not going to let this go. My daughter, her death is not going to be in vain.”","Peterson’s attorney, Michael Piper disagreed. Piper acknowledged that while this argument for defense may seem offensive and outrageous, as a matter of law, the deputy had no legal duty to confront the shooter.","“There is no legal duty that can be found,” Piper said. “At its very worst, Scot Peterson is accused of being a coward. That does not equate to bad faith.”","If we go back through decades of court cases, we will find that Piper is indeed correct.",Police in America are not required “protect and serve.”,"To be entirely fair, there were probably plenty of officers who would have rushed into the building that day but case law dating back to the 1930’s says they don’t have to do so.","The leading case on the topic is Warren v. District of Columbia, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. Ct. of Ap., 1981) when the Court stated that the “fundamental principle of American law is that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any individual citizen.”","In that case, police were directly alerted by Carolyn Warren, Miriam Douglas, and Joan Taliaferro that they were being held hostage by Marvin Kent and James Morse. Warren called police twice. But police never intervened and Warren, Douglas, and Taliaferro were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands of Kent and Morse—for over 14 hours.","The appellants argued that because police were alerted—twice—that police had a specific duty to protect them from the harm to which they were alerted. However, the court ruled in favor of police following “the well-established rule that official police personnel and the government employing them are not generally liable to victims of criminal acts for failure to provide adequate police protection.”","On top of this case is another from the Supreme Court dating back to the 1930’s which established the guidelines for federal government protection of citizens. In short, there is none. In the case of Erie Railroad Co. Vs. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L.Ed. 1188, the Court stated “there is no federal general common law. Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be local in their nature or ‘general,’ be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts.”","In fact, the only case establishing that police have a duty to protect individuals states that those individuals must be under direct responsibility of police at that time.","In the case of DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services (109 S.Ct. 998, 1989; 489 U.S. 189 (1989)), the court in DeShaney held that no duty arose as a result of a “special relationship,” concluding that Constitutional duties of care and protection only exist as to certain individuals, such as incarcerated prisoners, involuntarily committed mental patients and others restrained against their will and therefore unable to protect themselves.","As Peterson was merely assigned to the school for the ostensible presence of security, he was not directly charged with caring for any of the individual students. Therefore, the court will have a difficult time proving that he violated any duty by being a coward.","To be clear, these precedents were set in these cases—not to protect coward cops who refuse to confront shooters and allow children to die—but because police cannot be in all places at all times and therefore cannot be held liable for a person sustaining harm just because police failed to act.","So, while judge Henning in Florida may find it offensive that Scot Peterson cowered in fear that day and chose to hide instead of save the lives of children, she has to overcome multiple cases in which other much larger courts have said otherwise.","Even if judge Henning asserts that the children were under the direct care of Peterson and therefore he should’ve have acted, Warren vs. District of Columbia already set the precedent in a more direct scenario as these women asked police twice to help them, yet they failed to act.","The Peterson case will most assuredly shed light on the idea that police “protecting” you is a misconception. Police will seldom prevent violence because they are usually not there, and even when they have the chance and fail to act, they have not strayed from their duty.","The average response time to a 9-1-1 call is 10 minutes nationwide; for poor areas, that time quadruples. In some cases, the dispatchers do not even take the caller seriously and the victim ends up dead when a crime could have actually been prevented.",The reality is that police exist to enforce the law only.,"In a perfect world, police would show up prior to a crime and stop it, or at least during a crime, but this is simply not a reality most of the time. If there were enough cops to stop all crimes, this would require an Orwellian 1984 scenario with the state surveilling all citizens, all the time. While this would likely stop most of the crime, the conditions required to do so would be a living hell.","We need only look at prisons to see how even under the direct care of law enforcement, crimes, neglect, murders, and rapes, all still take place. No one in their right mind would ever want to live under such conditions in a free society.","

"A police officer was seen stuffing cash into his sock during a raid on a drug suspect. He told prosecutors it was a ""joke"" when he got caught, and they believed him. ","Victoria, CA — In a case that proves the notion cops can be seen breaking the law on video and not be charged, a police officer in Victoria was seen taking a suspect’s cash, shoving it into his sock, and he will face no charges. This is in spite of the fact that the department called the officer’s actions “concerning” and the taking of the money wiped away most charges over the raid.","According to police, they executed a raid on a resident in November of 2017. It was during this time that the officer was seen on a video recording from the suspect’s home, picking up a wad of cash from the desk and shoving it into his sock.","For six months, the officer thought he’d gotten away with it. However, during the trial of suspect Brian MacDonald, defense lawyers produced the hidden camera footage showing the officer’s alleged crimes.","As the video shows, the officer is in the room by himself, as he looks around. When he spots the cash, instead of seizing it in an evidence bag, the cop shoves it in his sock.","Now for the most ridiculous part. When confronted by his department, the British Columbia officer said he shoved the cash into his sock as a joke—and they believed him.","The department believes the officer because he claims he returned the cash after his “joke” of shoving it into his sock, with no one around to see it. However, there is a major problem with this joke claim as some of the bills shown in the video were never submitted as evidence.","According to the BC Prosecution Service, the gaps in the evidence do not provide sufficient proof to raise the allegation of theft. Apparently they watched the video with blindfolds on.","As CTV News reports, the service says several factors, including the presence of other possible suspects and an inability to acquire all the video from the scene, mean the evidence can’t support a prosecution.","Showing just how unnecessary the raid was, MacDonald was acquitted of all charges in September, except for a single count of possession of a controlled substance.","Highlighting the irony of this situation is the fact that the only person held accountable in this incident was a person selling another person a product they voluntarily agreed to purchase. When the alleged “good guys” showed up to prevent any further voluntary transactions, one of them was seen committing an actual crime of property theft and he will not face charges.",,"Sadly, as TFTP reports on a regular basis, this type of incident—including incidents in which cops are seen robbing people on video—is not uncommon. Even when there is overwhelming evidence against the officer, and they are found guilty, rarely do they face any accountability.","As TFTP reported last month, officer Linnard R. Crouch was seen on his own body camera—not helping a 74-year-old man who was having a heart attack—but robbing him. The elderly victim, James Mabe had the cash to go buy Christmas presents for his grandchildren, but because the cop robbed him instead of helped him he’d never make it. As we reported on October 4, the officer who stole a dying elderly man’s Christmas money will not be going to jail.","Last month, with almost no news coverage, Crouch pleaded guilty to robbing the elderly dying man. Instead of being punished for his utter betrayal of public trust and despicable act, Crouch was given probation and will not spend one day behind bars.","

The victim of a high-profile police brutality incident that happened outside of a Waffle House is now headed to trial—for being beaten by a cop.,"Warsaw, NC — Earlier this year, Anthony Wall took his 16-year-old little sister to prom and was enjoying a late night dinner at a Waffle House afterward when he was attacked by a massive cop for no reason. Now, instead of the officer who attacked him being held accountable, Wall is going to trial.","In May, the case gained national attention after video of the incident went viral showing officer Frank Moss treat Wall like an animal, slamming him back and forth, and choking him.","As WITN reports, Wall’s trial is expected to begin at 9:30 a.m. Thursday after being delayed while the SBI investigated whether or not Officer Moss used excessive force.","According to Wall, he and his sister had gone to prom and then stopped at Waffle House to grab a bite to eat. Wall says he got into a verbal argument with wait staff at the restaurant who then called police.","The officer who responded to the call was officer Frank Moss, who happens to be the most massive cop on the force.","To give you an idea of the sheer size of Officer Frank Moss, that’s him on the far right of this photo.",He has been brutalizing people in North Carolina for years on end.,"As soon as locals saw the video, they knew it was him. Said they’ve seen him do this before. pic.twitter.com/vWQXtfBDKb","— Shaun King (@ShaunKing) May 10, 2018",,"As the video shows, Wall is not violent at all as Moss throws him around, grabs him by the throat, and lifts him off the ground, before throwing the 22-year-old to the pavement and putting all of his weight on top of him.",Wall only began to “resist” when he feared for his life because he couldn’t breathe and thought he would die.,"“I was pretty much trying to scream for air and trying to breathe because he was holding my throat and that’s when I got aggressive with him because you are choking me,” said Wall.","During the altercation, Wall was injured after being choked and slammed to the ground by the massive officer. He suffered a back injury and abrasions.","That is Anthony Wall, in prom clothes, being lifted off the ground and choked by a Warsaw County police officer @WaffleHouse. He had just taken his little sister to prom. And yet again @WaffleHouse called the cops.","Anthony, of course was unarmed & non-violent.",This is assault. pic.twitter.com/lLupZbfMcW,"— Shaun King (@ShaunKing) May 10, 2018",,"Showing how he is a stand up man, Wall owned up to getting in an argument inside Waffle House, but noted that the police response was entirely uncalled for.","“Your hands should have never been around my neck like that if my hands were in the air,” said Wall.","After the video began to go viral, Warsaw Police Chief Eric Southerland responded by saying that the incident is currently under investigation.","“We are currently investigating the whole incident, interviewing witnesses and gathering additional video. We have also reached out to the District Attorney’s Office to make him aware of the investigation. Once the investigation is complete and the District Attorney has had a chance to review the case we will provide the public with an update on the findings.”","As the News and observer reported, when asked if the officer’s behavior in the video reflects what Warsaw officers are trained to do in such situations, Southerland said “no.”","“It’s not what you’re trained to do in incidents like this but when you’re dealing with someone fighting and resisting against an officer, you try to use proper tactics and go for one move, but that might not work because that person is moving or the officer is moving,” Southerland said at the time. “In real versus training situations, moves don’t always work out like you want them to.”","What’s more, is the fact that it has been six months since the incident, and no “investigation” results have been released.",,"As TFTP reported earlier this year, the NAACP has stepped up after a graphic video from inside an Alabama Waffle House went viral showing a violent police struggle with a young woman. During the violent encounter, the woman’s breasts were exposed.","

"Las Vegas, NV — For almost three years, medical marijuana was legalized in various regions of the state of Nevada. However, recreational marijuana sales only started in specific areas of the state at the beginning of July 2017 because of a law that took effect at that time; this law renders persons that are at least 21 years old and bear valid identification legally capable of purchasing the drug in those regions for recreational purposes. However, as a recent video shared with the Free Thought Project shows, police, lots of them, are still willing to attack and assault people for having the plant.","According to the new Nevada law, pot generally can only be legally imbibed on property owned privately by residents, and it may not be imbibed in any public location on the Strip such as a bar or casino. So, when Josh Martin sat in his truck to roll a joint—on private property—he was well within his rights, according to Nevada law, to do so.","The fact that Martin was not breaking any laws, however, was of no concern to the cops who showed up and assaulted the innocent man.","As the body camera footage shows, the cop even admitted to Martin that rolling the joint in his car was not illegal.","“I’m actually gonna interject,” says the officer. “It’s not illegal to roll a joint in your car and you have to identify yourself. Let’s cut the bulls**t.”","After admitting that Martin was not breaking any laws, the cop moved in to attack him, grabbing the innocent man by the neck and choking him down to the ground.","If what Martin was doing was perfectly legal, then he didn’t need to speak to the officers at all. If he was not suspected of committing a crime, the officers had no lawful reason to detain him and certainly no lawful reason to demand his identification.","In Nevada, police can legally stop someone and ask for their identification only if that officer meets the following:","None of these factors were present in the video below. Yet the officers still surrounded Martin, assaulted, and then kidnapped him.","This is the state of affairs in police state USA. Cops, addicted to the revenue and tyranny afforded to them by the war on marijuana, are unable to wean themselves from the immoral and unethical practice of kidnapping and caging people for possessing a plant.",, ,"

A NYC teen who accused two undercover NYPD officers of raping her while handcuffed is facing continual harassment for fighting her case.,"New York, NY — A process server has been arrested for “impersonating an officer” after he served a subpoena to Anna Chambers, the alleged rape victim who says she was sexually assaulted when two undercover NYPD officers took her away from her friends in an NYPD van in September 2017.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2']));","Corey Guskin, 59, was caught on camera insulting Chambers apparently harassing her by not leaving her door steps after serving her with the legal documents. The video, which has now gone viral, shows Guskin recording Chambers as she insists he leave. He calls the alleged rape victim a “stupid bitch.”","Chambers gained national attention to her case when she accused NYPD Detectives Richard Hall and Eddie Martins of raping her after they arrested her for marijuana possession on Coney Island Sept. 15th of 2017. As TFTP reported, Chambers used social media to voice her outcry for justice. She stated she was never actually arrested, just dropped off near the police station after she says Hall and Martins had their way with her, both men raping her while she was still in handcuffs.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","Her friends were also told she was being arrested and could be picked up at the NYPD station. They were also allegedly told not to follow the van, a possible indication they had planned the rape beforehand.","The 19-year-old also said she was harassed and intimidated while at the hospital being treated for sexual assault. Officers would come by her room, appearing to be concerned about her welfare. We’ve interviewed hospital personnel who say police routinely do this when someone speaks out against their actions and accuses them of criminal activity.","With respect to Guskin, the process server claimed to be representing the Sheriff’s Office. He said when asked to leave by Chambers:","Don’t tell me what to do. I’m from the Sheriff’s office, I can do whatever I want…Go screw yourself.",The middle-aged public servant (probably contracted by the courts through a company he works for) apparently knew who he was serving papers and may have developed an opinion about her case. This speculation is revealed when he brought up Chambers’ heritage. He stated:,"This isn’t Russia, I’m not the KGB…You stupid bitch.","For Guskin, justice was swift. He was arrested on Friday the 10th of August and is soon to be arraigned for impersonating an officer. New York Sheriff Joseph Fucito said in a statement:","The Sheriff’s Office takes impersonation of its officers very seriously. Impersonating a deputy sheriff damages the credibility and erodes public trust…Serving court orders is a critical component of the justice system and the Sheriff makes every effort to do so impartially, respectfully and professionally.","Chambers’ interaction with the process server who works for the court system is just the latest in a long series of reportedly painful scrutinizing of her case alleging she was raped by Hall and Martins. Incredulously, the officers claim she consented to having sex with the two badge-wearing strangers. Chambers not only denies those claims but also is prosecuting the two officers for premeditated rape. As a result, every aspect of her life has been picked apart by lawyers for the officers. Both Hall and Martins were arrested and charged with raping the teen.","Defense attorneys filed a motion for the charges to be dismissed against the officers saying the sex was consensual. But Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Danny’s Chun wasn’t having it. He ruled against the motion in April, saying:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'thefreethoughtproject_com-box-4','ezslot_7']));",I find no reason to review the grand jury minutes and no reason to dismiss.,"The case against the two officers and the case against Guskin are proceeding. We at TFTP will keep you abreast of any updates in Chambers’ quest for justice. Below is the video of the interaction between Chambers, her family, and Guskin. It’s safe to say he’s somehow connected to the ongoing harassment the teen has endured following her very public rape allegations.",THIS ISNT HARASSMENT ?! pic.twitter.com/X0SvaIfXRg,"— Anna Chambers (@annaaachambers) August 8, 2018",,"

"A Florida cop was arrested for beating a handcuffed teen on video, seen on video beating and spitting on a mentally ill man, and he killed a pedestrian with his car, and he can still be a cop.","Jacksonville, FL — When it comes to holding police accountable, America is an utter and complete failure. All too often, a cop can be seen on video killing unarmed and innocent people, beating handcuffed individuals and wreaking havoc in general and not face any punishment. Timothy James is one of those cops.","Earlier this year, James was charged after fellow officers witnessed him beating a handcuffed 17-year-old boy in the back of his squad car. As TFTP reported, he repeatedly punched  a 17-year-old child in the face. According to the reports, James climbed into the back seat of his patrol car, where two teens were waiting and handcuffed, and began punching one of the brothers in the face—hitting him so hard that he broke the boy’s teeth. The sergeant saw it all from his own patrol car and then, like a good cop is supposed to do, he arrested James.","For beating 17-year-old Elias Campos—while he was in handcuffs—James was arrested and charged with battery. However, thanks to a corrupt and broken system, these charges have now all been dropped.","As part of a plea deal released by the State Attorney’s Office, James had all charges dropped in exchange for his resignation.","Also, as New4Jax reports, James must perform 50 hours of community service, complete an anger management program and pay $170. James cannot commit any new local, state or federal offenses for three years.","Although he can’t be hired on back at the JSO for the next three years, James can go over to the next town and get hired on, right now. Seriously.","In a resignation letter, James wrote in part:","It is with a heavy heart and the deepest regret that I submit this letter of resignation. Coming to this decision was difficult, but I feel it is the best decision for me and my family. … It was an honor and privilege to work for this agency and I will deeply miss being a part of it.",He then requested all unpaid vacation and pension fund payouts which he will likely transfer over to another department who will probably hire him in the next few days.,"While a cop beating charges for punching a handcuffed boy is bad enough, it’s only the tip of the iceberg when we look at James’ sadistic and violent history.","As Jack Burns wrote earlier this year, the damning part of this story is that the beating of Campos was not the first time James had been arrested by his own police force. It was the second time — inside a month. But that’s not all. In fact, this model cop killed a pedestrian with his squad car too. And while JSO is prohibited from discussing his priors, investigative reporters with First Coast News uncovered his personnel file, which reveal the officer’s sordid work history.","On at least 10 different occasions, James has been in violation of departmental policy. Killing pedestrians and beating handcuffed kids is not the upper limit of this cop’s corrupt ability. In April, he’s alleged to have spit on and abused a mentally ill man at UF Health, the University of Florida hospital.","After news of James’ lack of charges, Campos’ attorney John Phillips released a response, calling it a “dark day for justice.”","At 3:09 (p.m.) today (Tuesday), we received the “disposition statement” related to the case against Jacksonville Sheriff’s Officer Tim James. We represent Elias Campos, the 17-year-old victim of Officer James’ repeated battery. He broke Elias’ teeth in an unlawful arrest. The State Attorney’s Office has chosen to dismiss these charges even though a fellow officer was willing to testify against Tim James. The terms of that dismissal are offensive and unjust.", ,"Officer James has a history of violence against the citizens of Jacksonville while hiding behind a badge. He also hit and killed our client, Blaine Land, while operating his police cruiser at a high rate of speed. He has bragged on his own Facebook page about … “whooping” people he encounters. Yet, he continued to be a paid member of JSO and now is simply asked to resign and forgo being an officer in the Jacksonville area. It is unacceptable and will only empower bad officers. He will move away and likely still be a law enforcement officer while sending a message to other officers that they can get away with crimes in Jacksonville.", ,"Three other points: We need police accountability. Jacksonville consistently investigates its own officers despite having a conflict of interest to protect its own department from liability. That needs to stop. We also need body cameras immediately. The delays need to end. Finally, for our State Attorney’s Office to publicly say it is “afraid” of trying tough cases sends a message that it is weak on crime and it is empowers police officers who push the boundaries to continue to do so.",It is a dark day for justice in Jacksonville.,"To highlight the disparity between how the victims view this situation as compared to the police, we can look at the response from the Fraternal Order of Police who wished this violent cop well, noting, unironically, that the justice system worked as intended.","“The criminal justice system has worked as intended and we wish Tim James well in the future,” Fraternal Order of Police President Steve Zona said in a statement.",,"

"Disturbing video served as the impetus behind a settlement, paid out to kids who were forced to fight for officers' entertainment in a child fight club.","Cleveland, OH — Cuyahoga County taxpayers will shell out $180,000 this week to settle a lawsuit brought by former children housed in the juvenile detention center—who were forced to fight each other for the officers’ entertainment in some sort of child fight club.","According to the lawsuit and the video, the officers would pit two children against each other in what they referred to as “Fight Nights.” This was a long standing tradition inside the juvenile detention center, according to the suit.","Luckily, for the victims, at least one of the fights was caught on video and served as evidence showing the officers chuckle and laugh as the kids tore each other apart. In the disturbing video, one child is seen throwing a punch and then body slamming another child before jumping on top of him.",Another video showed officers locking the children in a room and forcing them to fight until only one of the kids emerged victoriously.,"“They were encouraging it for their own entertainment. We don’t know if they were gambling among themselves, but if you look at the video there was a lot of laughter. This was their Friday night entertainment which, as human beings and plaintiffs attorneys, we found this to be egregious behavior,” said Thomas Perotti, one of the attorneys representing the juveniles.","Indeed, these kids were in the system to ostensibly get “rehabilitated” but instead, they were forced to fight in some club for the officers in some sick desire for entertainment.","“Incarceration or detention doesn’t give the government any right to tell the people who are in their custody [to fight]. So, this was just such an outrageous set of events that it demanded action and it demanded the only appropriate route to go,” said David Malik, another of the attorneys involved.","According to FOX 8 Cleveland, because the case was settled before discovery, attorneys said they could not really determine how many other inmates were involved or for how long the activity had taken place.",The suit did however reference the “good old days when nurses assisted in the cover up of fight nights by providing covert medical assistance.”,"To cover up their criminal behavior, according to the suit, the officers instructed the kids to avoid hitting each other in the faces.","“The primary purpose of juvenile justice is to rehabilitate, and when I saw what was going on I was aghast. I was like, this can’t be happening. This is like 50-years-ago and this is happening in our back yard and this is only what we know about,” said Perotti.","Although both guards involved in the videos have resigned, neither of them reportedly faced any criminal charges.","Also, as part of the settlement, the county has scheduled a meeting in which the juvenile inmates can confront the other officers in the facility to let them know how this insanity impacted their lives, both physically and emotionally.",,"Sadly, officers running a fight club in prison is not an uncommon situation—including child fight clubs.","As TFTP reported earlier this year, an officer from Broward County, Florida was caught smashing in the face of a 14-year-old boy. A subsequent report exposed the fact that the officer had been accused of also running a child fight club.","According to the Herald,","Andrew was one of several detained or incarcerated youths who told investigators, their parents or the Herald that officers incited teens to fight each other. Often, the youths said, teens would be offered honey buns, hamburgers or other treats as a reward for attacking another youth, records showed. The beatings that followed often were called “honey-bunnings.”","Despite these accusations, no investigation was ever conducted into the alleged club and the officer who broke the face of the skinny 14-year-old boy was ruled justified in his actions.","

"After police arrested a mother for suspicion of DUI, they failed to remove her 4-year-old daughter from the back of the van, leaving her to freeze overnight in the impound lot.","Milwaukee, WI — A family is speaking out this week after the arrest of a mother nearly led to the death of a 4-year-old little girl. Monday night, police arrested the girl’s mother and seized her van, when they impounded the van, they left the little girl inside—in freezing temperatures, overnight.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","It was an “unfortunate situation,” Milwaukee city engineer Jeff Polenske said at a news conference. “Apparently the girl was very upset and crying, something that none of us would like to have happen to any of our children.”","Indeed, it could have been far more “unfortunate” had the girl not survived the frigid temperatures.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","As FOX 2 reports, the National Weather Service reported temperatures at Mitchell International Airport were around 25 degrees around midnight — with a wind chill of 14 degrees. The temperature dropped to as low as 19 degrees with a wind chill of five degrees around 7 a.m. When the girl was found, the temperature had edged up to 22 degrees with a wind chill of nine degrees.","According to police, the girl’s mother was pulled over around 12:30 a.m. because officers suspected her of driving under the influence. During the stop, the mother was arrested on suspicion of DUI charges. A 10-month-old baby was also in the car and was taken into custody by police, but the 4-year-old was left sleeping in the back seat.",The exact circumstances of the arrest are unclear and so is the reason for police not searching the vehicle after arresting the driver.,"When the mother was arrested, the van was then placed on a flatbed tow truck and taken to a tow lot. After it was brought to the city’s lot, the system failed once again as no one inspected the vehicle as they are required to do.","“This is something that none of us would like to have happen to any of our children,” said Polenske. “As a father of three, this is something that — very upsetting to me personally and certainly upsetting to all that were involved with this.”","After her mother was arrested, the girl would spend the next 8 hours in temperatures that were well below freezing and would not be found until 8:30 a.m. when she was heard screaming and crying in the back of the van.","“The Milwaukee Police Department is grateful that the child was located unharmed. MPD is currently seeking criminal charges against the driver who was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated,” the department said, according to the station. “We will provide additional information in the upcoming days regarding this investigation.”","Short of a catastrophic emergency in which there is no other option but to drive, there is absolutely no excuse for a mother to get behind the wheel with two young children in the car while drunk. If she is found guilty in this scenario, she deserves to be held accountable.","That being said, however, the fact that police failed to find the little girl in the backseat of the van is also inexcusable. This little girl could’ve froze to death in the back of that van that night because of the negligence of the system.","“I’m frustrated right now because I’m trying to figure out why the whole van wasn’t searched,” Dynasty Davis, the girl’s aunt told KTVI. “She’s in good spirits, coloring, eating good, being a child.”","“I couldn’t even understand myself lasting that long,” Davis said. “All those hours.”",,"

Now, we have the disturbing video of the aftermath of the shooting. It is nothing short of heartbreaking.",The boy who was killed this week for allegedly intervening to help his mother fend off a cop was Joseph Haynes and he was unarmed.,"Video of the aftermath was taken by Constance Gadell-Newton, Juvenile Defense Attorney for Franklin County Ohio who witnessed the lethal altercation and pulled out her camera to document it.","In the video, we can see Haynes’ mother hysterical after her son lay dying on the floor of the courtroom.

At this point officers then begin to forcibly remove the mother and the grandmother who are in obvious shock after witnessing Joseph’s killing.,"On Friday, authorities identified the officer who fired the lethal round as Deputy Richard Scarborough.","When asked if there was surveillance footage of the shooting, Chief Rick Minerd, of the Sheriff’s Office investigative subdivision said that the video doesn’t provide a view of the altercation.","“That video is not as fruitful as we would have liked, in terms of what it shows,” Minerd says. “And so we’re hopeful there’s other information out there.”","According to WOSU, Minerd says they are looking for cell phone footage that may help the case. He says they’ve interviewed about 20 people so far in the case, but are having difficulty collecting reliable information because the altercation began in one location and ended in another.",,Below is the report on the original incident.,"The single shot which killed Haynes was fired, police say, in self-defense but family members are disputing that claim. The boy’s grandmother Geraldine Haynes said she witnessed the entire incident. In an interview with the Columbus Dispatch, the grandmother recounted the incident.",They had an altercation in the courtroom. The judge gave us another court date and we were leaving.

We’re trained, absolutely that you can’t allow that to happen…It was very clear to me, and in my experiences, that he was attacked and this was a fight for his life at some point.","Not only was Ferrell not present, but the only person giving an eyewitness account of the shooting, the boy’s grandmother, stands by her version of events which led to her grandbaby’s death.","Various news reports have made it a point to mention Hanyes’ prior run-ins with the law, stating the teenager had already been charged with various crimes. But the fact remains. An unarmed boy was killed in a courtroom defending his mother from an armed man who was reportedly running roughshod over her.",Joseph Haynes was the 55th American to be killed by police in America so far in 2018.,,"

However, these tactics have proven that they do not work because it has been a serious issue for over 50 years and things have only gotten worse. The drugs have gotten dirtier and more dangerous, and the black market has gotten more violent, as the prison time associated with these drugs has continued to climb.","Heroin addiction is a serious problem, but as counter-intuitive as it sounds, the best way to prevent heroin overdoses is to actually legalize it and treat people like this clinic does in NYC. Certain areas of the world, like Portugal, where all drugs have been decriminalized, there are far fewer overdoses than there are in prohibition countries. The Washington Post reported that drug overdoses are extremely rare in Portugal, and they have some of the lowest rates of addiction in the world.","People have the impression that under drug legalization, things would just be out of control and drug addicts would be addicts everywhere, but this is not what actually happens.","Currently, under the state of prohibition that most of the world experiences, the treatment, and help that addicts receive is severely limited, mostly to punishments and highly regulated inpatient and outpatient programs. In an environment of prohibition, the strategy is punishment instead of harm reduction, which is actually a much more humane, realistic and effective way of handling serious social problems like heroin addiction.","Examples of harm reduction tactics would be needle exchange programs, drug testing kits at raves, or supervised safe injection sites, just to name a few. Teaching condom use for sexual education, instead of abstinence is another example of how harm prevention is applied to other social issues.","As the war on marijuana dies down, police are seeking to turn their attention on heroin so they can still continue to generate income off of helpless drug users. Often times, they target methadone clinics as they are target rich environments. Luckily, however, many community workers and addiction counselors are starting to realize that police state tactics are not the solution.","

"Claiming that officer Amber Guyger ""engaged in adverse conduct when she was arrested for Manslaughter,"" the department finally fired her. ","Dallas, TX — After the Dallas police department refused to fire an officer who admitted to killing an innocent man, outrage erupted, and rightfully so. Now, however, on Monday, the department announced that officer Amber Guyger has finally been fired.","On Monday, the Dallas police department announced that the officer who admitted to walking into the apartment of 26-year-old Botham Jean and killing him, was finally fired.","“Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall terminated Police Officer Amber Guyger, #10702, during a hearing held September 24, 2018,” the statement read. “An Internal Affairs investigation concluded that on September 9, 2018, Officer Guyger, #10702, engaged in adverse conduct when she was arrested for Manslaughter.”",The department then went on to note that Guyger could appeal this firing under their civil service rules.,Officer Guyger was terminated for her actions. She was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division.,"Under civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline.",pic.twitter.com/Bvt4ixHGsl,"— Dallas Police Dept (@DallasPD) September 24, 2018",,"This move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired. As recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, “There is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger. I don’t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.”","Also, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law.","“I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action. There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall.","Apparently, it is no longer against the law.",This news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning.,"As TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong. While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt the she did kill him. This is a fact. This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead. Because of her actions, this man no longer lives. This alone, should have been enough to fire her.","Surprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, “Good,” showing her support for the move.",Good. https://t.co/kWSAynIJeT,"— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 24, 2018",,"For those who don’t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today.","Indeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George’s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment. He shot two officers. Not only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized.","In response to Guyger’s termination, the family’s attorney, Lee Merritt noted that the family expressed “satisfaction” with the move.","“The Jean family expressed satisfaction in this explanation and in Guyger’s termination. We see it as an initial victory — well received on the day Botham Jean is laid to rest in his native country in St. Lucia,” Merritt’s office said in a statement, adding that they are committed to see a “proper murder indictment, conviction and appropriate sentencing.”","

A Cleveland judge is refusing to send people to jail after multiple people have died under mysterious circumstances in just the last four months. ,"Cleveland, OH — In the last four months, six inmates inside the Cuyahoga County Jail have met an untimely demise. The suspicious nature of their deaths and the subsequent blocking of information by the jail has one Cleveland Judge taking action and refusing to send people to jail who are charged with crimes.",Cleveland Municipal Judge Michael Nelson announced this week that he will no longer be sending people to the jail unless they are accused of committing horrible crimes because inmates keep turning up dead.,"Instead of locking them up, Nelson will set personal bonds for people—meaning that the judge will turn people loose on their own accord instead of making them pay bail. The judge reached out to Cleveland.com this week to tell them that he plans on reaching out to the court’s administrative judge, Michelle Earley, to set up a meeting to figure out why so many inmates are dying.","“The first thing I did this morning when I saw [the cleveland.com] story is look to see if it was someone I sent to jail,” Nelson said. “I’m giving personal bonds to everyone from now on unless they’re the worst of the worst until things get figured out at the jail.”",Earley told Cleveland.com via an emailed statement that she has set up a meeting with jail officials to get to the bottom of this string of deaths.,"“Both the warden of the county jail and the Chief of Public Safety for Cuyahoga County have agreed to meet with me so that the Court can get a better understanding of what is going on with the jail, what has happened in these situations and what plans the jail has/will implement to prevent further inmate deaths in the facility,” Earley’s statement said.",The most recent death involved 44-year-old Martin Gomez who died just four days after being booked. Gomez was thrown in the jail for possessing less than five grams of cocaine. Gomez couldn’t afford the $150 bail to get out of jail and four days later he would be found dead.,"Adding a shroud of mystery to Gomez’ death is the fact that Cuyahoga County officials have refused to release any details as to how he died. County spokeswoman Mary Louise Madigan would not say when Gomez was taken to the hospital or the circumstances surrounding the death, according to Cleveland.com.","Had Gomez come across judge Nelson, he may still be alive today.","After the judge announced that he would start refusing to send people to jail, Cuyahoga County announced that it will hire an outside investigator to look into the six inmates who died in four months.","The county issued a statement Wednesday noting that Cuyahoga County Executive Armond Budish’s administration will ask the county council to approve funding for an independent expert to investigate the jail’s entire operation, including the downtown Justice Center, the Euclid and Bedford jails, according to Cleveland.com.","“We are very concerned about the recent deaths in the County jail,” the statement said. “While each situation is individual and we are still in the process of investigating the causes of each inmate’s death, there is a common thread – each death occurred within our County jail system.”",,"As TFTP has reported, hundreds of people die in jail every year across the country. While this number is certainly shocking, what’s even more shocking is the fact that over 75 percent of them were never convicted of a crime—meaning they were too poor to pay their bail—and died waiting to see a judge.","The details behind these deaths are largely unknown, and in most cases the blame is put on the inmate, either for health reasons, or alleged suicides.","According to one report, of the 12,623 deaths reported in local jails from 2000-2012, only 3,105 of them were actually convicted of a crime. The other 9,518 inmates were never found guilty before dying in their cages. If we extrapolate these numbers out to days, on average, 2 people die in jail every single day, who’ve never been found guilty of a crime.",Perhaps judge Nelson will raise awareness to the fact that not everyone accused of a crime needs to be thrown in jail. Those who haven’t committed violent crimes or who are accused of traffic offenses and other state related victimless crimes would most likely benefit from not being thrown in a cage.,"

"Even though a man's death was ruled a homicide, not one of the 10 detention officers who were responsible for his death have been charged.","Native American Jorden Stevens, a member of the Cocopah Indian Tribe, died on February 15, 2017, while in the custody of the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office (YCSO) Adult Detention Center. Even though his death was ruled a homicide, not a single corrections officer has been charged with his murder.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","The Yuma County Sheriff’s Office conducted an internal investigation but the details of their findings have not yet been made public. Now, Stevens’ family—after more than a year of not getting any answers and having only the Sheriff’s Office to blame—is planning on filing a lawsuit again the department for the death of their loved one.","Stevens was arrested for “disorderly conduct” and was taken to jail, but as he was leaving, a dispute between the 29-year-old and officers led to an escalation of force involving at least 10 YCSO officers. In newly released video footage of the attack, which lasted over 10 minutes, a gaggle of officers can be seen appearing to kick and punch Stevens, who reportedly suffered a traumatic brain injury possibly leading to his death.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","According to the claim filed by Stevens’ family, the young man suffered red marks associated with taser burns, as well as bruises, abrasions and blunt force trauma from a closed fist. Cornelius “Candy” Camarena is representing Winona Stevens, Jorden Stevens’ mother in a wrongful death lawsuit against YCSO. Camarena said that Jordan Stevens was being discharged and released from the jail when the incident occurred.","In the process of him being released, he was assaulted by numerous Yuma County Sheriff detention officers.","It is important to put the attack into perspective. Without regard to the fact that the attackers were wearing badges and uniforms, if a gang of 10 identifiable individuals had given a beat down to the Native American on the street, someone would have been arrested. But because the gang of individuals who beat Stevens to death were law enforcement officers, no one to date has been arrested for what the medical examiner determined was a “homicide.” Camarena says he is left with only one alternative, to sue the County and the Sheriff’s Office.","Our next step is to file a lawsuit. We’ll be filing a lawsuit in Federal district court, alleging a violation of Mr. Jorden Steven’s civil rights.","Local reporters attempted to get the YCSO or the District Attorney to respond, but neither would speak to the correspondent, citing the ongoing investigation. Predictably, police apologists were quick to blame the victim in comments made to the story that aired on Yuma’s KYMA News 11. One man, Joe Whittle, pointed out the obvious. He wrote:",There was not a single moment where those cops did not have the upper hand and overwhelming physical force. They murdered him…I have a hard time understanding why you think disorderly conduct and resisting arrest is a death sentence worthy crime? Wake up and get your life together if you think men scuffling/fighting means one of them should die. You need to get a clue about what real life is like.,"Unfortunately, as has been our experience at The Free Thought Project, just as in the high-profile NYC case of Eric Garner, not one police officer has been tried for the homicide of Jorden Stevens. In fact, as TFTP has reported, the only person to ever see the inside of a jail cell in Garner’s homicide was the man who was filming the incident.","

 ,"Montville, OH – Former Montville Township, Ohio, police officer and former Wayne County probation officer, Carl Kannenberg, was charged with raping a 7-year-old girl while she was a patient at University Hospital in February.","According to the indictment cited by Cleveland 19, the former law enforcement officer “is charged with committing anal penetration and with inappropriate sexual contact” for sexual assaults which Cleveland.com says occurred multiple times. ","A Cuyahoga County grand jury charged Kannenberg with two counts of rape, two counts of gross sexual imposition, and two counts of kidnapping.","According to the indictment, three of the sexual assaults occurred at the hospital— while his young victim wore a hospital gown — where Kannenberg was visiting another patient, and another incident happened prior to that at a separate but unnamed location.","Joe Frolik, spokesman for the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office, told Cleveland.com that Kannenberg was not working for University Hospital at the time of those sexual assaults, but had been visiting another patient. ",Frolik added that hospital personnel helped report the incidents to police. ,"The Free Thought Project tried to contact officials, however, neither Frolik nor the appropriate officials with Wayne County could be reached for comment Saturday. ","“Patient safety is our highest priority. UH takes the safety of our patients very seriously,” University Hospitals Spokeswoman Alicia Reale said, refusing to comment directly on the case in question. “We are continually refining and strengthening our protocols to maintain a safe environment for our patients and their families.”","Inexplicably, Kannenberg, 34, who was arrested on July 12, has since been released pending arraignment on August 17. ","With charges as explicitly, brutally violent in nature forcibly committed against such a young child in the further vulnerable position of being a hospital patient, Kannenberg’s freedom until his next court date defies both reason and any possible sense of safety or justice for his victim. ","In fact, one has to wonder whether Kannenberg’s status as a former law enforcement officer played a role in his being able to roam freely until arraignment despite being charged with the rape of an innocent 7-year-old child. ","Frolik stated Kannenberg left the Montville police department in 2015, and then served as a Wayne County probation officer from August 2015 until March this year. ","Kannenberg’s LinkedIn profile still lists him currently employed in the Wayne County Municipal Court as a Community Service Coordinator, and that he has been in law enforcement for four years in total. ",No further details were available regarding the sexual assault that occurred prior to the multiple incidents at the hospital.,"These incidents are not uncommon, especially when involving children who choose to be around police through the explorer program.","Last month, former Canterbury Police Chief John Laroche was charged with sexually assaulting a former member of the Boscawen Police Explorers. His alleged victim was a 16-year-old girl.","Lasy year, former Trumball police officer William Ruscoe began a drastically reduced 30-month prison sentence for handcuffing and raping a teenage girl in his home. His victim was an explorer.","Trever Blackwell, 30, was jailed in September 2014 for raping a 15-year-old girl while she was in the department’s Explorer program.","Before that incident, several sex charges were filed against a former Irwindale police officer who allegedly molested a 14-year-old Explorer Scout.",The list goes on.,"

A city's police department has already tied its own annual record for officer-involved shootings—and it is only August. ,"The Phoenix Police Department set a new record last month and—it was not for the cutest lip sync challenge. PPD officers have shot 31 citizens this year, tying the record set for shootings in one year, and it is only August!","The officer-involved shooting record will undoubtedly be broken, and soon, if the law of averages holds true. Phoenix city leaders are concerned, even commissioning a new study to investigate why the number of officer-involved shootings has seemingly skyrocketed past previous years.","Following the previous record of 31 shootings that was set in 2013, an Arizona State University study was undertaken to examine the phenomena and according to AZ Central, called for “reform and enhanced training” for officers. Such training, as The Free Thought Project has advocated, should include de-escalation training which all Salt Lake City, Utah officers attended. As we previously reported, officer-involved shootings in Salt Lake have plummeted to near zero.","The Phoenix Police Department accounts for 31 of the 59 officer-involved shootings county-wide, roughly 50 percent of a metropolitan area encompassing 10 police departments. To put it into perspective, AZ Central writes, “there were 21 Phoenix Police Department shootings in 2017; 25 in 2016; and 17 in 2015, according to department data.”","Phoenix Law Enforcement Association President Ken Crane appeared to reject de-escalation training as a helpful notion telling The Republic in an earlier interview, “A cop can have all the de-escalation training in the world, but it’s not necessarily going to work all the time if you’re dealing with extremely volatile, uncooperative people.”","AZ Central compared the shootings in Phoenix with two other similar in size metropolitan areas: San Antonio and Philadelphia, both with 1.5 million residents. To date, San Antonio has only seen eight officer-involved shootings, while Philadelphia has a mere four. The 31 shootings by law enforcement officers in Phoenix is almost four times as many as San Antonio and is over seven times as many as Philly.","Making matters difficult to study, there exists no mandatory reporting by law enforcement agencies to a national database of officer-involved shootings—an implementation which could shed light on when such shootings occur as well as their causes. From such data, preventative measures could be put in place to ensure officer safety as well as the safety of the general public on the other side of the sights of police firearms.","For now, Phoenix city leaders await the findings of the research study recently approved, as officer-involved shootings across Maricopa County continue to climb. As we were writing this story, another officer-involved shooting occurred in Phoenix late Tuesday afternoon. Maricopa County’s officer-involved shootings have even surpassed those of Los Angeles.","Something is definitely wrong in Phoenix, and unfortunately, we proclaim the glaringly obvious. Police in Phoenix are shooting people in record numbers, no one knows why, and no one is doing anything about it, except spending taxpayer money to study what some residents already know. Officers do not face consequences if they open fire on innocent citizens, they have qualified immunity, and when they are charged with murdering someone, they can get away with it scot-free.","In December 2017, Mesa PD officer Phillip Brailsford was found not guilty of killing a Walmart pest exterminator, Daniel Shaver, at La Quinta Inn after Shaver begged for his life, and was forced to crawl on his hands and knees, and was shot and killed for reaching back to pull up his shorts, which were falling down. Someone reportedly called 911 after seeing Shaver with his air rifle inside the hotel, a rifle he did not have at the time he was shot dead in the hotel hallway. Mesa is also in Maricopa County.","The likely message sent to all of the county’s officers, after Brailsford was found not guilty, is ‘there’s nothing you can do and not get away with, even killing someone in cold blood.’ Such a message sent in 2017 is now being followed by record-setting police shootings in Phoenix in 2018. How high the police shootings will go once we get to the end of 2018 is anyone’s guess. But right now, there’s no end in sight.","Calls for a Citizen Review Board of such shootings failed miserably in 2017. As TFTP has reported, when police departments investigate themselves, with respect to officer-involved shootings, they predictably come to the conclusion (more times than not) that their officers did nothing wrong. Wisconsin is the only state in the union whereby officer-involved shootings are investigated principally by outside agencies.","

"Blowing the one bad apple theory out of the water, an entire department in North Carolina has been suspended after the two top cops were arrested for conspiracy. ","Southport, NC — All too often those who continuously apologize for crimes committed by police officers are able to justify some of the most egregious instances of outright murder by claiming the officer was a bad apple. Almost as often, however, as TFTP has shown numerous times, the bad apple theory is exactly that—a theory—with no evidence to support it.",Illustrating the nature of the bad apple theory is the fact that another entire police department in North Carolina was suspended recently after the department’s chief and lieutenant were arrested on conspiracy charges.,"Chief Gary Smith, 46, and Lt. Michael Christian Simmons, 48, were both charged with conspiracy to obtain property by false pretenses, willful failure to discharge duties, and obstruction of justice, according to CBS17.",As CBS17 reports:,State investigators said Smith and Simmons were driving overnight shifts for an unnamed local trucking company during the same hours they had claimed on their daily activity reports for the Southport Police Department.,David said Smith and Simmons’ duties for the trucking company routinely required them to be out of town and even out of the county.,"Smith was taken into custody Thursday morning and booked into the Brunswick County Detention Center under a $10,000 unsecured bond. He was later released after posting bail.",Simmons was taken into custody during Thursday afternoon’s news conference announcing the results of the investigation.,"“It is indeed that I get before you today with a heart laden with grief for all these events that happened today,” said Mayor Jerry Dove. “It was a shock to me to hear all these, being a former chief and knowing the officers that worked in that department and hired at least half of them.”","For the time being, the Brunswick County sheriff’s office has moved in to cover for the duties of the police department and there are no issues.","“We will be relying on (the sheriff’s office) substantially on the road ahead to step into the void and provide a police presence,” District Attorney Jon David said. “The sheriff’s office already has overlapping jurisdiction with Southport. It’s not new that they would be patrolling these streets. They know the lay of the land and I’m very confident that citizens will be well protected.”","According to David, at least one of the suspended officers is the reason the others were exposed as he came forward to shine light on the corruption.","Entire police departments getting suspended for rampant corruption is not uncommon. In fact, as TFTP reported last year, the entire drug unit of Troy, New York’s Police Department was placed on administrative leave following reports that the unit entered a home without a warrant.","According to the Times Union, the officers entered a home after they were tipped off by another Capital Region police agency. But then they lied about it.","Apparently, they realized they made a major mistake, but then compounded their problems by attempting to cover their tracks. They allegedly filed a false burglary report.","More recently, four people in the Llano Police Department, including Police Chief Kevin Ratliff, were arrested earlier this year for being bad cops.","There are eight law enforcement officers employed by the Llano Police Department, according to the LPD’s website, meaning that half of the police force has been indicted.","Do these instances seem like “one bad apple,” or a potentially much greater problem?",,"

Chicago police have been accused of entrapment after setting up a bait truck in a low income neighborhood full of expensive goods that were easily accessible. ,"Chicago, IL — Police in Chicago have recently come under criticism for setting up a “bait truck” in a low income area with the intent of enticing people to steal from it. The truck was left wide open with expensive goods like brand new shoes and appeared to be unsupervised. But there were police watching just out of view, waiting to catch anyone who might give into the temptation.","Alderman Roderick Sawyer, 6th chair of the City Council’s Black Caucus, pointed out that police in the city have more important things to do than target low income neighborhoods with traps.","“This bait truck operation is an unacceptable and inappropriate use of police resources. In a moment where police capacity is clearly under extreme strain, these sort of tactics are the last thing we should be spending manpower and energy on,” Sawyer said.",The operation was exposed by local activist Charles Mckenzie who recorded one of the arrests and posted it to his Facebook page.,"The operation was defended by Susan Terpay, a spokeswoman for the Norfolk Southern Railroad police, who said that these areas were targeted because freight trucks have been burglarized there in the past.","“The suspects saw a parked, unmarked trailer and then proceeded to cut open the safety seal with box cutters, broke into the back of the trailer and only then did they find retail shoes in unmarked brown boxes, previously secured and hidden inside,” Terpay said in an email with the Chicago Tribune.",One of the people arrested was a deaf man who can only communcate through sign language. When he was arrested he told the officers that he had entered the truck in search of food.,"Despite the excuses from the Norfolk Southern Railroad Police and the Chicago Police Department, this situation is obviously a clear case of entrapment. Entrapment is a legal term to describe the unethical law enforcement tactic of pushing someone to commit a crime that they otherwise would not have taken the energy themselves to carry out.","Entrapment is “the conception and planning of an offence by an officer, and his procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer,” according to the legal precedent Sorrells v. United States.","Obviously, if this truck was not parked in this neighborhood on this day, it is highly probable that no freight heists would have taken place. The strategy in place by local police seems to be a rudementary “minority report” system which seeks to prevent future crimes by taking “potential criminals” off the streets before they actually do anything.","Karen Sheley, director of the ACLU of Illinois’ police practices project pointed out that the Chicago police should be more concerned with the wave of murders that the city has been experiencing.","“Police in Chicago must focus on building trust and better relationships within the communities they serve, not engage in stunts like bait trucks. The Chicago Police Department admits that it can’t solve murders and violent crimes because communities of color don’t trust the Chicago police. These stunts won’t help,” Sheley said.","The plan was even criticized by Mayoral candidate Lori Lightfoot, who is actually the former head of the Chicago Police Board.",The operation was eventually called off when local residents realized what was happening and chased the police out of their neighborhood.,"In one of the videos that residents took of the operation, one man who was being arrested can be heard saying, “They left a bait truck with … a lot of Nikes in there. Why would you all do that in the hood, though?”","He raises a good question, it seems highly unethical to leave a truck filled with expensive goods wide open in a neighborhood where people are struggling to put food on their tables. There aren’t many people alive who can resist that type of temptation when they are in a situation like that one.","

"A man's call to 911 for help ended up with him in the hospital after police showed up, handcuffed him, and proceeded to taser him in the testicles while choking him. ","Chattanooga, TN — A man’s call to 911 for help turned into a nightmare last month after police showed up and nearly killed him. On October 21, a 27-year-old maintenance worker, Christopher Penn was handcuffed, choked, tasered on his testicles, and beaten until he fell unconscious.","That night, Penn was in need of mental health help. Clearly delusional, he had called 911 telling police that he had taken some pills and said a friend let some people into his home who wanted to kill him. Six officers showed up.","As police enter the man’s bedroom, he is on the phone, not resisting and allows officers to place him in handcuffs—despite not having committed a crime. As officers put the handcuffs on him, he is peaceful but now scared that police are trying to set him up.",“Why y’all trying to set me up?” he asked.,"“Hey, Dad! I’m handcuffed now, and they’re going to put a gun on me,” he said talking to the phone on his bed. “You heard me?”",“Dad!” he repeated.,"“Nobody’s on the phone,” one of the officers said.","Obviously scared and still fairly delusional, Penn repeatedly asked the officers if he could sit down, a request officers repeatedly denied.","According to the police report, Penn was violent, tried grabbing a child as police escorted him out of the home, and beat up officers. However, the police report is not backed up by video of the incident.",As the Times Free Press reports:,The body camera footage doesn’t entirely match up with the report.,"As he entered the living room, Penn, who is black, repeatedly asked why the police wanted to kill him, the footage shows. He panicked, tried to run and fell onto a couch beside a child, bringing an officer down with him.","Later, inside the patrol car, Penn tried to run out but never kicked the door open. Officers grabbed him from the door area and wrestled him to the ground. Face pressed to the asphalt, Penn promised to cooperate, and they lifted him up. But he bucked and thrashed, pulling officers across the street to another car.",The bodycam footage doesn’t show police trying to put him in the car feet-first.,"When Penn kicked at one of them, an officer pressed a Taser to his groin and held down the trigger for about five seconds. Though use of a Taser is marked on the report, there’s no mention of it in the narrative section of the use-of-force report.","At the end of the interaction, after police had repeatedly choked and tasered the handcuffed man, his body finally gave out and Penn fell unconscious.",“Is he breathing?” one of the officers asked.,"The body camera then shows an officer walk up to Penn and slap him on his face and get no response. He then confirms Penn is breathing and police do not bring Penn to jail. Instead, they dump him at the hospital and that was that.","As the Times notes, no officers were waiting when Penn was released from the hospital and went home. Penn only found out later East Ridge police had taken out warrants against him for assaulting two of them and misusing the 911 system, and he has yet to be served.","“One of the nurses told me I ought to be glad to be here, that they thought I was going to die,” Penn said to the Times. “The police choked me. They tased me.”","Chattanooga attorney Robin Flores, who is also a former police officer agrees. In an interview with the Times, Flores days he does not believe the force used was justified.","“That’s excessive force,” he said. “Period.”",Indeed. Penn is lucky to be alive as many folks in need of mental health help are not so fortunate and are routinely killed by police responding to their calls for help.,,"

They deployed flash bang grenades and held everyone in the home at gunpoint to arrest Cribbs’ tenant for selling a plant.","Both the family and police agree on everything that happened above. However, the story of how and why Jessica Cribbs was killed varies greatly depending on whether you are talking to the cops or the family.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","According to police, when they breached the home, Cribbs pointed a gun at them and she refused to drop it. This prompted at least one officer to open fire on her and she was killed. Police said that two other individuals, including an infant were also injured in the melee. However, they refused to release any details about how they were hurt.",None of the deputes were harmed.,Below is the statement from the sheriff’s department:,"Just after 6:00 a.m., Thursday morning, the Tactical Impact Unit (TIU) along with members of Citrus County Sheriff’s Office SWAT team and the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office SWAT team executed a drug search warrant on 6019 W. Rio Grande Dr. in Beverly Hills. SWAT team members announced themselves multiple times before entering the residence. Preliminary information indicates that they encountered a white female subject who was armed with a gun. After refusing verbal commands to lower her weapon, the subject was shot by deputies. She was pronounced deceased at the scene. Two other individuals were injured during the execution of the search warrant and were transported to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The two individuals have since been treated and released. No deputies from either agency were injured.",The Free Thought Project spoke to the son of the victim who tells us that the official story released to the press is not true. Tommy Cribbs says he was in the home at the time of the raid and his mom was in her bedroom.,"When Jessica Cribbs, who, according to Tommy, is a bedridden wounded warrior veteran, heard the flash bangs go off, she tried to get up to see what was going on. Tommy tells TFTP that his mother never had time to grab a gun and that police shot her through a glass window.","What’s more, although police didn’t mention how the others were injured, according to Tommy Cribbs, they were shot. Cribbs husband, also a military veteran, was shot in the leg and the infant girl was also hit.",Both of them were transported to a local hospital where they were treated for their injuries.,"According to Tommy, his mother rented out a room in their large house to help a homeless man. Unbeknownst to Jessica and her husband, the man who was renting out the room began to sell marijuana. This was the apparent impetus behind the search warrant and the raid.","It is also backed up by the fact that police arrested two people in the home, who are not related to the Cribbs. Cody Lynn Blagburn and Cameryn David Holloway were both arrested and charged with the alleged distribution of marijuana. They were both released on an $8,000 and $6,000 bond respectively.","Police allegedly found 4 pounds of the plant in Blagburn’s room that he rented from Jessica. For 4 pounds of a plant that is legal in some form in over half the country — including Florida — a small army of militarized police officers descended on a family’s home as if it were occupied by members of Al-Qeada. In a tragic irony, they killed an innocent woman who sacrificed her own health and well-being to defend the country who would treat her like this. A travesty indeed.","Tommy tells the Free Thought Project that his dad was the primary caretaker of Jessica and they were barely getting by. Tommy says that they have very little income anymore and are unable to pay for Jessica’s funeral and all the repairs to the home from the damage caused by SWAT. He has setup GoFundMe account, here to pay for the funeral and the damage.", ,"

"Despite being seen on video choking an 11-year-old girl, slamming her to the ground, and lying about it under oath, a cop was secretly ruled justified and kept his job.","New York, NY — In 2015, video surfaced of New York City police lieutenant Paul Gaglio assaulting an 11-year-old girl on a Bronx street corner. The incident happened six months after Eric Garner’s death and showed the cop using an illegal choke hold, proved he lied under oath, and yet he still has his job. His employment also comes in spite of the fact that he frequently posts anti-Muslim and anti-black content on social media.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","Not only was this cop not fired for lying under oath, attacking an innocent 11-year-old girl, and posting racist comments on social media—but he was never even disciplined—and the department justified his brutal actions.","Alluding to the fact that they knew what they were doing was wrong, the NYPD attempted to cover up the investigation they claimed they carried out.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));",As Buzzfeed News reports:,"Confidential department documents and court records reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that in August 2016, the NYPD secretly declined to punish the lieutenant, determining that he had not used excessive force. Then-commissioner Bill Bratton went the extra step of shutting down an internal examination of the officer’s actions, sparing Gaglio from standing trial in front of the department’s in-house tribunal.","Today, Gaglio patrols Yankee Stadium, earning $163,000 last year. On Facebook, he has shared anti-gay memes, images denigrating Islam, and posts demeaning black people. (The posts were deleted after BuzzFeed News inquired about them.)","While speaking about his actions that day, Gaglio stated under oath that the girl, wrongly accused of trying to steal a cellphone, tried to resist arrest through “intimidation, physical force, or interference,” and that the two of them had slipped on a patch of ice. However, video footage proved that Gaglio lied and he was the aggressor.","In the video, the large male cop forced the girl against the wall, then grabs her around the neck and throws her to the pavement, where he handcuffs her before leading her away.","In a sworn statement, the police lieutenant lied about what happened, saying she “and I both slipped and fell to the ground. On the ground [she] continued to flail her arms and thrash her body, preventing me from placing handcuffs on her. We continued to struggle until I was eventually able to place handcuffs on [her].”","As we can see in the video below, no one slipped to the ground, and the girl was not flailing and thrashing. It is pure brutality. The assault was just another example of NYPD harassment in minority communities, perhaps motivated by racism, all too similar to the circumstances leading to Eric Garner’s death.","According to civil rights lawyer Bob Herbst, who represents the family, the girl was simply an innocent bystander to a situation that could have been resolved peacefully.","“This past February, after school was out for the day, some boys from the school were throwing snowballs at a passing car. When the driver got out to yell at them — and put one of the boys in a headlock — his smartphone fell out of his pocket and another boy picked it up. Upon realizing his phone was gone, the driver chased down one of the boys and threatened to call the police if the phone was not returned, and when it was not forthcoming, he did, apparently using someone else’s phone.","This 6th grader — let’s call her Angie — and a classmate were walking from school to the bus stop when they saw some of this. They were bystanders who had nothing to do with either the snowballs or the phone. But as the police arrived, the girls exchanged words as to whether they should stay to watch, or go, and then took off running for a block before stopping.","The driver — the man in the white jacket with the knapsack in the video — seeing Angie running, suspected — wrongly — that she was part of the group and had his phone. He approached Angie and asked for his phone. She told him she didn’t have his phone.","Shortly thereafter, as the video starts, this police lieutenant crossed the street, motioning for Angie to come toward him, which she did.”",It seems that running away was enough for the enraged cop to brutalize the girl instead of peacefully ascertaining that she did not have the phone.,"If this wasn’t enough for the girl’s psyche, the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York (which prosecutes Family Court proceedings) began a juvenile delinquency proceeding against her. This happened one month after the girl’s parents decided to file claims of police assault and battery and the use of excessive force. Since no action was taken against the girl for four months after the arrest, the proceeding raised the suspicion that the Counsel retaliated after the family said they intended to sue.","Fortunately, the video was preserved by the noble shopkeeper who allowed it to be copied onto the mother’s phone, and this is what proved the cop to be a liar. The obvious unprovoked brutality forced the Counsel to dismiss the case six months later, according to Herbst.",The police lieutenant’s gross abuse of power and the city’s shameful attempt at prosecuting the 6th grade victim has put the girl in a state of psychic distress.,"“Her parents report that she now talks and cries in her sleep, and sometimes sleep walks. She is scared of and avoids the police. She does not want to think about or talk about what happened to her. She stays home more, does not like to go outside, and her relationships with friends have changed as she has become more withdrawn.”",,"

"While most indie media was focused on debating the way people talk about Kanye West and the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an unprecedented escalation in internet censorship took place which threatens everything we all care about. It received frighteningly little attention.","After a massive purge of hundreds of politically oriented pages and personal accounts for “inauthentic behavior”, Facebook rightly received a fair amount of criticism for the nebulous and hotly disputed basis for that action. What received relatively little attention was the far more ominous step which was taken next: within hours of being purged from Facebook, multiple anti-establishment alternative media sites had their accounts completely removed from Twitter as well.","As of this writing I am aware of three large alternative media outlets which were expelled from both platforms at almost the same time: Anti-Media, the Free Thought Project, and Police the Police, all of whom had millions of followers on Facebook. Both the Editor-in-Chief of Anti-Media and its Chief Creative Officer were also banned by Twitter, and are being kept from having any new accounts on that site as well.","“I unfortunately always felt the day would come when alternative media would be scrubbed from major social media sites,” Anti-Media’s Chief Creative Officer S.M. Gibson said in a statement to me. “Because of that I prepared by having backup accounts years ago. The fact that those accounts, as well as 3 accounts from individuals associated with Anti-Media were banned without warning and without any reason offered by either platform makes me believe this purge was certainly orchestrated by someone. Who that is I have no idea, but this attack on information was much more concise and methodical in silencing truth than most realize or is being reported.”","It is now clear that there is either (A) some degree of communication/coordination between Twitter and Facebook about their respective censorship practices, or (B) information being given to both Twitter and Facebook by another party regarding targets for censorship. Either way, it means that there is now some some mechanism in place linking the censorship of dissident voices across multiple platforms. We are beginning to see smaller anti-establishment alternative media outlets cut off from their audiences by the same sort of coordinated cross-platform silencing we first witnessed with Alex Jones in August.","This is about as acute a threat to our ability to network and share information with each other as anything you could possibly imagine. If new media outlets are beginning to silence dissident voices together in unison, that means we can see entire alternative media outlets not just partially silenced but thoroughly silenced, their ability to grow their audiences and get information out to heavily populated parts of the internet completely crippled.","This is huge, this is dangerous, and this is being under-reported. When I was removed from Twitter in August for “abusing” John McCain, there was a large and outraged uproar on Twitter, and my account was quickly restored with an apology. And I’m really grateful for that, but the phenomenon of multiple high-profile alternative media outlets suddenly being silenced in unison by the two biggest social media platforms should be generating more outrage than some ornery Australian blogger losing her Twitter account, not less. This should be the top story in alternative media, because it affects us all.","Any time you try to talk about how internet censorship threatens our ability to get the jackboot of oligarchy off our necks you’ll always get some guy in your face who’s read one Ayn Rand book and thinks he knows everything, saying things like “Facebook is a private company! It can do whatever it wants!” Is it now? Has not Facebook been inviting US government-funded groups to help regulate its operations, vowing on the Senate floor to do more to facilitate the interests of the US government, deleting accounts at the direction of the US and Israeli governments, and handing the guidance of its censorship behavior over to the Atlantic Council, which receives funding from the US government, the EU, NATO and Gulf states? How “private” is that? Facebook is a deeply government-entrenched corporation, and Facebook censorship is just what government censorship looks like in a corporatist system of government.","Speaking of the Atlantic Council, it recently published a very interesting 21-page document about a US military conference detailing, in present tense, how Silicon Valley tech giants are being used to nullify the threat that the new media landscape poses to the US power establishment.","Of this document, World Socialist Website writes the following:","The best way to deal with a manipulative sociopath is to point and make a lot of noise every time they do something weird and creepy. The more you let them abuse you in private, the more they can rope you in and get you playing along with their sick agendas. If you notice them doing something weird, the best way to nullify all the tools in their wicked little toolbox is to point and yell “Hey! What are you doing?? Why are you doing that? That’s weird!” Get people looking, because such beasts can’t advance their manipulations with a lot of critical eyes on them.","Propaganda and censorship operates very much the same way. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of the Streisand effect, I encourage you to begin to acquaint yourself with it. Named for an incident in which Barbra Streisand attempted to suppress online photographs of her Malibu residence and thereby inadvertently drew far more attention to them, the Streisand effect describes the way attempts to hide and censor information can be used to draw more attention to it if the coverup attracts the interest of the public eye. Every censor needs to prevent this from happening in order to do their job effectively; if it looks like removing something from public view would draw more attention to it, then they cannot practice censorship in that case.","So let’s Streisand this thing up, hey? Let’s make a big angry noise about this new cross-platform escalation in internet censorship, and let’s make a big angry noise any time anyone makes a move to silence dissident political speech in the new media environment. Manipulators can only function in darkness, so let’s never give them any. Anything they try, we need to make a ton of noise about it. That by itself would be throwing an enormous stumbling block in their path while we find new ways to clear a path for more and more networking and information sharing.

"In a repulsive interview, Texas Senator Ted Cruz told reporters that we shouldn't be so quick to judge the cop who gunned down Botham Jean in his own home.","Dallas, TX — In a repugnant and outright disrespectful move, Texas Senator Ted Cruz went to bat for Amber Guyger, the cop who admitted to taking the life of the innocent 26-year-old pillar of society, Botham Jean.","During an interview over the weekend, Cruz sat down with FOX 26 who started with the question of what he thought about the tragic killing of Jean by Guyger. FOX 26 asked Cruz to respond to his Democratic midterm rival, Beto O’Rourke, who called for officer Guyger to be fired.","“I think we are all counting on the district attorney, on those in positions of trust and power right now, to do the right thing,” O’Rourke said, implying that, at the very minimum, Amber Guyger should be fired. “There has to be a full accounting for how young black men continue to be killed in this country without accountability, without justice, without these full investigations, without respecting their civil rights. This cannot continue.”","In response, Cruz lashed out at O’Rourke, claiming that he is being too quick to judge.","“I wish Beto O’Rourke & Democrats weren’t so quick to always blame the police officer,” Cruz said Saturday during an interview with Houston’s KRIV. “She may have been in the wrong … but I don’t think we should jump to conclusions.”","Cruz responds to O'Rourke support for DPD firing Amber Guyger: ""I wish Beto O’Rourke & Democrats weren’t so quick to always blame the police officer. … She may have been in the wrong … but I don’t think we should jump to conclusions"" amid investigation https://t.co/68nHBodrOM","— Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) September 17, 2018",,Cruz then went on to call the situation a tragedy and said that if a jury of her peers finds she did something wrong then Guyger should suffer the consequences.,"To be clear, Amber Guyger admitted to doing something wrong. While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt the she did kill him. This is a fact. This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead. Because of her actions, this man no longer lives. That, Senator Ted Cruz, is wrong.","Mistake or not, she killed an innocent man. She is the only one to blame and yet she is still collecting a paycheck from taxpayers. Calling for Gugyer to be fired is not the same as calling for people to be fired for making stupid Instagram posts or saying stupid things—she killed an innocent man. At the very least, she should be fired from her job which gave her the gun to do it.","What Ted Cruz is doing is the same thing the police and their apologists are doing. They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system. In Cruz’s eyes, Guyger going into an apartment that wasn’t her’s and killing an innocent man was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—a tragic mistake that ruined two lives, according to Cruz.","But that is not the case at all. Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed? If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her—would police and Ted Cruz simply write it off as a tragic accident?","Of course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, FUCK NO.","To shut down the peanut gallery before it begins, this is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left. This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong. There is no other way around it, “mistake” or not.","From the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line. Amber Guyger’s home was never searched while Jean’s apartment was searched that night. The results of the blood test to test for alcohol or drugs in her system were never released, yet police — on the day his mother buried her son — claimed they found marijuana in his house. It’s been a smear campaign from the beginning and it is this way by design.","Amber Guyger took an innocent person’s life, and because people are so blinded by the badge, she is being portrayed as the victim. To those who attempt to claim there is no bias in this horrifically flawed system, if ever there was a case to prove you wrong—this is it. A tragedy indeed.","

He says as they were leaving, some guys were taunting them, which led him to show the men the gun in his waistband. Redrick has a license to carry and received his permit for the gun a month before the shooting.","Moments after showing his legal gun, Redrick explains that someone began shooting from behind them. Fearing that they were about to be murdered by an unknown assailant, Redrick’s brother Pruiett picked up the gun and shot back in an act of self-defense.","Once Pruiett realized it was a cop, he dropped the gun and surrendered but he’d already been shot several times.",No officers were hurt during the shooting yet Pruiett and Redrick were both hospitalized for severe injuries sustained from the gunshots.,"“This how my book end,” Redrick said “This is how my story end.

"After a former deputy announced he was running for sheriff, his home was raided and his wife was kidnapped by deputies. ","Clayton County, GA — In the land of the free, practicing democracy is often futile and even more often, highly corrupt. Illustrating the corrupt nature of this process is a case out of Georgia in which a sheriff with a history of alleged criminal activity is accused of harassing, intimidating, and even arresting innocent people who challenge his authority.","On August 10, Robert Hawes, a former deputy with the Clayton County sheriff’s department, announced that he would be running against the incumbent Sheriff Victor Hill. Days later police would be in his home, kidnapping his wife.","“This sounds like an effort to intimidate a potential political opponent, which is in my mind, not an appropriate use of law enforcement powers,” Harvey Newman, professor emeritus at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University told AJC. “We want people to feel able to speak truth to power. But this appears to be an effort to, if not silence that, to at least intimidate it.”","After Hawes announced his desires to seek Hill’s job, Hawes says that’s when Hill went on the offensive, sending out emails disparaged Hawes’ sons, accusing them of stealing their father’s department-issued gun in 2014 and selling it at a pawn shop. Hawes said the accusation is untrue.","“I bet you if we did an open records request of the emails that came from the sheriff, there would be some nasty threats from him,” he said. “The only reason he is doing what he is doing is because I said I was running for sheriff.”","When they heard of the false claims, Gerrian Hawes, Robert’s wife, emailed the sheriff and said, “Where there is love, fear cannot exist.”","For this, deputies were sent to their home to arrest Gerrian for making threats to the sheriff.","“All this comes after I made the announcement I was running for sheriff,” Robert said. “She responded because she thinks he is trying to place fear into us.”","As the AJC reports, Hill has an extremely corrupt and checkered past:","Hill has been the leader of the Clayton Sheriff’s Office since 2013, his second go-round in the top job after running the department from 2005-2008. When the seat was up for re-election in 2016, he received 63 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary.","Over the years, however, detractors have described his behavior as everything from reckless to criminal.","When he first took office in 2005, he immediately fired 27 employees, placing snipers on the sheriff’s department roof as they were escorted out. In 2012, he was accused of several counts of racketeering, theft by taking and making false statements, though he would later be acquitted of all charges.","In 2015, he accidentally shot a female friend while demonstrating “police tactics” during a date. And last year, his law enforcement certification was put on probation for two years by the Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council.","This year, he has been linked to Mitzi Bickers, a Clayton Sheriff’s chaplain who was indicted in April in connection to the bribery scandal at Atlanta City Hall. Charges against her include witness tampering, wire fraud and money laundering.","Rodney Williams, a former Clayton Sheriff’s Office chaplain, experienced a similar fate to Gerrian after he emailed the sheriff, noting his “evil agenda.”","After the email, Hill took out a warrant for Williams’ arrest as well. Williams told AJC that he could predict Gerrian’s arrest after her husband’s announcement, as this is the sheriff’s normal tactic.","“I saw it coming, that’s just how he operates,” said Williams, who was at the courthouse Thursday to support Gerrian Hawes. “You give him a little bit of bait, the snake will stick his head out because he does not have any self-control. That’s just what he does.”","Indeed, as the video shows, the sheriff will have his minions allegedly silence anyone who attempts to dethrone him.",,"

Body camera video has exonerated an innocent man who became the target of aggressive deputies after he asked them for directions at a football game. ,"Buffalo, NY — Practicing your First Amendment right to free speech, in the land of the free, can and will get you beaten, kidnapped, or worse. As the body camera video below illustrates, you can be polite and courteous but when a raging cop snaps—and then lies about what happens—there is very little you can do to protect yourself.","Nicholas H.

And it all began over asking for directions.","That day, Belsito’s friend had been arrested for allegedly hitting a cop’s elbow with an empty beer can. As his friend sat in the back of the police cruiser, Belsito wanted to ask for directions so he could pick him up at jail.","“I’m sorry,” he says politely as Deputy Kenneth Achtyl lowers his window, “I’m just wondering where you guys are going, so I’m going to meet my friend there …”",“Who’s your friend?” Achtyl says.,“The kid in the back.”,"“OK, well, you want to go to jail with him?” Achtyl asks threatening to kidnap and cage a man for asking for directions.","“No, I …”",“Then beat it.”,"“No,” Belsito says, as he tries again to learn where the deputies will take his friend.","“He’s going to jail,” Achtyl says. “Beat it.”",“Can you tell me the location?” Belsito asks.,"“Ten Delaware,” the deputy tells him. “Now beat it.”","Belsito, who is not from the area, didn’t understand that ‘Ten Delaware’ was the address of the Erie County Holding Center.

However, 14 seconds later, once Flowers emerges from the vehicle, we see Achtyl on video gripping Belsito from behind with blood dripping from his face.","“Put your (expletive) hands behind your back,” Flowers shouts as Belsito attempts to comply with the order.",Achtyl then throws Belsito to the ground and puts him in handcuffs.,"Belsito had done nothing wrong, yet he found himself being beaten and kidnapped by police. What’s more, once it was all said and done, police would paint Belsito as a dangerous and violent criminal.","Lying through their teeth, the deputies’ sworn complaint against Belsito says that when he was told he was under arrest for swearing  “the defendant did fight with the arresting deputies by swinging his arms and attempting to pull away.” The complaint goes on to say he “engaged in fighting” and in “violent, tumultuous and threatening behavior.”","As the body camera footage below shows, this was all lies.","According to the Buffalo News, Belsito’s attorney says he has photos and witness testimony that covers the 14 seconds before Flowers’ video picks up, which prove that Belsito never fought with the deputies. Glazer also provided another video from a bystander that shows Achtyl repeated smashing in Belsito’s face with his baton while doing very little to protect himself.","After Belsito was beaten and kidnapped, the officers charges him with multiple counts of disorderly conduct, obstructing governmental administration and criminal mischief. However, as soon as the DA reviewed the video, all those charges were dropped.","“The assistant DA took one look at this video and dismissed everything,” said Glazer. “I’m a former prosecutor and I don’t like to take on cases against law enforcement. But this was just too egregious.”","The body camera Flowers was wearing that day was an experimental one which the department was testing out to lower instances of false claims of brutality against officers. However, this had the exact opposite effect. The department now remains tight lipped on whether or not they will continue with the program.","As the video below shows, being innocent, polite, and compliant is no defense against a cop on a rampage. Had there been no video, rest assured that it would have been the deputies’ false words against Belsito and this innocent man would likely be rotting in jail. ",,"

Dozens of cases are being dropped after a cop was caught planting drugs on his own body camera.,"Marianna, FL – Earlier this month, Jackson County Deputy Zachary Webster was fired after an investigation revealed that he planted drugs on multiple suspects. Now, prosecutors are dropping a least two dozen different cases that he was involved with after his own body camera showed him framing innocent people.","Last month, The Florida Department of Law Enforcement opened up an investigation on Wester after body camera footage confirmed allegations that he planted drugs on innocent people. However, the investigation into allegations of official misconduct is still open, and no charges have been filed against Wester.",State Attorney Glenn Hess of the 14th Judicial Circuit said that he believes Wester is guilty after seeing the evidence.,"“The investigation is not complete. However, I saw a video, and I saw still photographs captured from that video that caused me to lose confidence in the cases that the deputy has made. It is an unfortunate situation. However, as the state attorney, I have a responsibility to make it right,” Hess told the Tallahassee Democrat.","In a letter sent out to Webster’s victims, Hess said, “Please be advised that our office has information that an investigation into the professional conduct of Deputy Zachary Wester is underway. No conclusions have been reached, nonetheless, you should be aware of its existence.”",Hess also downplayed the seriousness of the situation by suggesting that since it was just a drug crime most of these people were looking at probation.,"“Basically, we’re dealing with possession of controlled substances. So I would expect that the people affected would at worst be on probation. Nevertheless, we are looking at all of the cases and their outcomes,” Hess said.","However, Webster planted hard drugs like meth on many of these people which can carry steep sentences. Also, this caused problems for many people who were already on probation.","Monica Willis has been sitting in jail since March 28 because Webster planted drugs on her during a traffic stop. Willis was reportedly two weeks pregnant at the time, and it is possible she may have had to give birth in prison.",Her attorney Robin Myers said that Webster was doing this as a way to turn people into confidential informants.,"“The M.O. seems to be that there’s a traffic stop in which either a request to search the car is made or the deputy determines probable cause to search the car. And then upon searching the car, narcotics are located. At which point the deputy gives the defendant the choice to either work as a confidential informant or go to jail,” Myers said.",,"If you think police officers planting evidence is some anomaly, think again.","After their department gained national shame last year over a video showing an officer planting drugs to frame an innocent man while his fellow cops watched, the Baltimore Police Department showed the world the dark reality that is framing people to make arrests. Only days after the first video was released, the Baltimore Public Defender’s office released a second video that allegedly “appears to depict multiple officers working together to manufacture evidence.”","It was then announced that nearly three dozen people will have their charges dropped after the video of Officer Richard Pinheiro showed him planting drugs while Officers Hovhannes Simonyan and Jamal Brunson stood by and did nothing. Naturally, the BPD claimed nothing unscrupulous was going in in the aforementioned videos.","It is not just Baltimore cops either—as TFTP previously reported, in one of the most shocking cases of badge abuse ever exposed, the Alabama Justice Project revealed that a ring of corrupt cops in the Dothan Police Department planted drugs and guns on hundreds of young black men for over a decade, in most cases resulting in their imprisonment. Their actions were aided by supervisors and covered up by the district attorney.","

"After a sheriff's department in Kentucky unapologetically handcuffed tiny children in a torturous manner at school, the taxpayers were held liable.","Last week, a sheriff’s office in Kentucky agreed to hand over $337,000 in taxpayer money for a federal lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children’s Law Center that finally made progress after a deputy sheriff handcuffed—and seemingly tortured—two small elementary school students who have disabilities.","The children “were so small that the deputy sheriff locked the handcuffs around the children’s biceps, forcing their hands behind their backs,” Susan Mizner wrote announcing this week’s settlement.","In an extremely disturbing video, which TFTP reported on in 2015, school resource officer, Kenton County Deputy Sheriff Kevin Sumner, can be seen handcuffing a sobbing 8-year-old boy, referred to in court documents as S.R. The child is so small that Sumner has to lock the child’s biceps together behind his back. What makes the case even more appalling is that the child has a history of trauma and has been diagnosed with ADHD.","The other child named in the lawsuit, a girl named in the suit as L.G., was twice handcuffed in the same manner as S.R. She is a special needs student and has also been diagnosed with ADHD.","Neither child was accused of criminal conduct nor were they arrested or charged with a crime, but were being punished for behavior issues.","According to the ACLU, the lawsuit has finally been settled despite the sheriff disgustingly standing behind his deputy’s actions.","Months of discovery showed that Deputy Sheriff Sumner had handcuffed another young plaintiff twice and had also handcuffed up to 20 other children. Nonetheless, Sheriff Charles Korzenborn of Kenton County declared, “I steadfastly stand behind Deputy Sumner.” The sheriff also said, on the record, that handcuffing children behind their backs was an acceptable practice for his deputies.","Last year, a Federal court disagreed and the lawsuit was continued. Federal District Court Judge William O. Bertelsman found that the handcuffing of these two children was “an unconstitutional seizure and excessive force.” Judge Bertelsman also found, as a matter of law, that Kenton County is liable for the handcuffings.",When did it become acceptable to treat students who misbehave or act out as if they are criminals? These were children—tiny ones—and they were treated and abused like prisoners of war.,"According to the ACLU, due to the fact that this treatment is so commonplace, makes Judge Bertelsman’s decision is a significant win. Not only did the court find that the sheriff’s office was wrong, the judge reached this decision at summary judgment, issuing a decision on these issues before the case even went to trial.","According to the ACLU the court had to give the sheriff the full benefit of the doubt — assuming that everything happened exactly as the deputy sheriff claimed. But even with this wide deference, the judge held the sheriff’s office liable and their actions unconstitutional. As Judge Bertelsman noted, even if SR swung an elbow at Officer Sumner, this “can hardly be considered a serious physical threat from an unarmed, 54-pound eight-year-old child.”","After the handcuffings, both children had repeated nightmares, started bed-wetting, and would not let their mothers out of their sight. Both families left the school district, and moved to areas where their children could receive the treatment and accommodations they needed. —ACLU","As the ACLU notes, the settlement comes as the national debate heats up over whether to boost the number of law enforcement officers in schools. The plaintiffs in this case were small children in need of support and understanding. They needed someone who understood the effects of their disability on their behavior and could help them with appropriate accommodations. Law enforcement does not have those tools.  Indeed, the tools they do have — handcuffs, batons, pepper spray, and guns — are particularly inappropriate and harmful in the school environment.","As tragic as this story sounds, it is sadly not an isolated one. Young children with disabilities often find themselves on the receiving end of police state violence while attending public school.","Colton Granito, an 8-year-old boy with autism, threw a tantrum during class. Instead of following the boy’s IEP plan, police were called. Colton was handcuffed, transported to jail, and forced to sit in a cell for hours wearing a straight jacket. He was subsequently charged with assault and sentenced to probation.","The photo below is of a 10-year-old child handcuffed, laid out on the back of a police cruiser. The boy’s name is Ryan, and he has autism. He misbehaved at school and was also arrested and treated like a criminal.",,"In September of 2014, we reported on body cam footage showing a 9-year-old special needs boy handcuffed as his father pleaded with the officer to release him.","That same month, a highly disturbing video of cops manhandling a 13-year-old autistic child as he screamed for help emerged on Facebook.","And these cases contain only autistic children. If you truly want a glimpse into the horrid effects of the police state on all school children, take a scroll through our archives, at this link.","“The State represents violence in a concentrated and organized form. The individual has a soul, but as the State is a soulless machine, it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes its very existence.” -Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi",,"

After police failed to hold their own officers accountable for attacking an innocent 84-year-old grandmother—hospitalizing her—she is now fighting back. ,"Mesa, AZ — An Arizona family has learned the hard way what calling the police to help a relative can often look like as their grandmother was hospitalized after a welfare check. Showing their incompetence, the welfare check was for another family member but the police assaulted the innocent grandmother anyway. Now, the grandmother is filing a lawsuit and the taxpayers will likely be the ones held accountable.","The Free Thought Project reported on the incident when it happened in February. Days after the incident, police released body camera footage showing how this grandmother got so hurt.","Although they released the video, the Mesa police department deliberately blurred the entire clip. However, even low resolution can’t hide the sadistic act of abusing an innocent grandmother.","As we previously reported, Ashlee Hahn detailed the assault in a dramatic Facebook post which showed the extent of her grandmother’s injuries. Hahn’s grandmother, Virginia Archer was hurt so badly during the check that she had to be hospitalized.","“I’ve never been treated like that in my life,” Archer told KTVK. “Nobody had ever treated me like that. And I certainly didn’t think it would be the police,” she said holding back tears.","“It only takes watching that video for one minute to know that these officers’ actions were improper and most likely criminal,” Archer’s attorney Solomon Radner said. “And they’ve done nothing. So now, we need to do something,” he said of the lawsuit.","Virginia Archer filed the suit last week at the U.S. District Court in Phoenix, alleging she was unlawfully arrested on Feb. 14 and subjected to “excessive, brutal and completely unnecessary force” by Mesa police officers who went to her home checking on the safety of her grandson.","The complaint names officers C. Orr and D. Grimm, as well as the department.","“Defendant Orr’s and Defendant Grimm’s actions were uncalled for, and they knew it immediately,” the lawsuit says. “Since they knew they were wrong, they attempted to justify their actions by lying to multiple people that Plaintiff (Archer) was being combative and/or ‘not following directions at all.’”","According to Hahn, at the time her grandmother was “recovering from her fourth stroke and is confused, cognitively impaired & barely physically able to stand on her own because of uncontrollable shaking.”","Hahn’s mother had called in a welfare check for her son who lives on Archer’s property. She told police her son was suicidal. Police were even given specific instructions not to disturb the 84-year-old because she is easily confused and fragile. When police arrived, the son was fine, but, as the body camera footage shows, the innocent grandmother was not.","“The police were called to her residence for a wellness check for a close family member who lives on her property,” explained Hahn. “They were specifically asked not to bother or question my grandmother because of her present and very fragile state.”","In spite of telling them to steer clear, however, police did the exact opposite.","“They forced her out of her home into the street, holding her arms tight enough to leave bruises and bleeding,” wrote Hahn. “Her inability to hold still (because of her previous strokes, as seen in uploaded videos) inclined them to slam her down, head first on the asphalt. They handcuffed her after she woke from her unconscious state.”","Indeed, the video shows this exact scenario. Officers forced the woman from her home by repeatedly telling her to come toward them. When she gets by them, she was clearly confused and had no idea what was going on.","Illustrating just how out of it she was, Archer starts referencing officers being behind the cars like a movie. As she turned around, the officers grabbed her and then surrounded her.","“You are not following my directions,” says a cop to the severely frail innocent elderly woman. Moments later, the innocent grandmother is slammed to the ground as cops jump on top of her and put her in handcuffs.",,"When Hahn’s grandmother woke up, she was in the hospital, bloodied and bruised. Police then immediately began conducting damage control.","“After seeing the damage they had done & sending my Grandmother off in an ambulance, they called my Mother (who made the original wellness check call) and told her that my Grandmother “slipped,” Hahn explained.","To try and alleviate their liability, an officer was sent, not to check on an elderly grandmother who’d just been the subject of a savage attack, but, instead, to defend their fellow cop and his choice to inflict harm on an innocent old lady.","“The officer who came down to the hospital only seemed to care about deflecting & defending the officers involved. No accountability. No apologies,” Hahn wrote.","What’s more, to try to legitimize the attack on an innocent grandmother, police then charged her with obstruction.",Hahn filmed part of the interaction with the officer in the hospital as he defended his fellow cop’s decision to needlessly confront her (against the family’s wishes) and then violently throw her to the ground.,“Why did he put me down on the asphalt?” asked the innocent elderly woman.,"“It is my understanding when I spoke to the officer, that you pulled away from him a little bit and he took action like that, okay?” the officer callously explains of how his fellow officer could somehow rationalize assaulting an innocent grandmother.",Pulling away from an officer “a little bit” in the land of the free will now apparently result in innocent elderly women being thrown to the ground.,"Despite the incident happening nearly six months ago, no news of discipline for the officers involved has been released. The Mesa police department only said that the investigation is still currently underway.",,"

"Two police officers have been arrested for kicking two handcuffed teens and spitting on them during an arrest, according to a federal indictment.","Springfield, MA — A federal indictment was unsealed this week during the initial court appearance of two Springfield cops accused of roughing up two Latino teenagers while telling them “welcome to the white man’s world.”","Springfield police Officer Gregg Bigda and former detective Steven Vignault claim they did nothing wrong and pleaded not guilty during their first court appearance on Wednesday. After their not guilty plea, both men were released without bail.","After the incident in February 2016, Bigda was suspended for 60 days while Vignault was allowed to retire.","According to the report, Bigda kicked one of the teens in the head while arresting him for the alleged theft of an unmarked police SUV. While kicking the teen, Bigda then spat on him and made the “welcome to the white man’s world” comment.","According to MassLive, on the night of Feb. 26, 2016, Vigneault left his unmarked police car running outside a pizza restaurant while he went inside to get food. When he came back out, a group of teens had taken his car on a joy ride before they were eventually stopped and apprehended.","Police dogs then allegedly bit the boys and officers allegedly kicked them in the face while they were handcuffed, according to WaPo. Bigda then went on to interrogate the teens without their parents present and without reading them their Miranda rights, according to the indictment.","Both of the boys were injured during the arrest but their abuse did not stop there. As the video below shows, the teens were then subjected to an interrogation “so abusive that it shocks the conscience,” according to the prosecution.","As PIX 11 points out, at one point, Bigda pointed to blood on his boot. He warned the teen that if he lied, his blood would be on the boot, as well, the indictment said.",Bigda faces additional charges of filing a false police report and in connection with obscenity-laden threats he allegedly made during a subsequent interrogation of one of the suspects.,"“Even in the face of adversity, law enforcement officers are expected to conduct themselves professionally, respectfully, and with integrity,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a statement. “They are ambassadors for the rule of law, and when they themselves break those laws, they violate not just the rights of their victims, but compromise the public’s trust in law enforcement.”","Naturally, attorneys for the officers are urging the public not to rush to judgement and claim their clients will be exonerated.","“There is a tendency to rush to judgment in cases like these,” Daniel Kelly, an attorney for Vigneault said outside the court on Wednesday. “We would ask that the public not rush to judgment.”",Bigda was charged with three counts of deprivation of rights under color of law and one count of filing a false report.,Vigneault was charged with one count of deprivation of rights under color of law.,Whether or not the two teens were actually guilty of the crimes which they were accused is unknown as their records are not public since they are children.,"It is important to point out, however, that even if they were guilty, the actions of these officers tainted the case. Now, instead of getting the punishment they may have deserved for stealing a car, these two teens will likely receive a hefty settlement for the abuse dished out to them by Springfield’s finest.","Because these two cops couldn’t control themselves, the taxpayers will likely be paying dearly. ",, ,"

"A good cop crossed the thin blue line this week to expose felony crimes within his department, so he was immediately fired.","New Holland, OH — New Holland Police Sergeant Brad Mick was doing his job of trying to fight crime in the city of New Holland, and for his dedication to duty, he was fired. This good cop was relieved from duty because the alleged criminals he went after were part of the thin blue line.","Mick dared to call out corruption in his own department by executing a search warrant and filing charges against the mayor, the current police chief, and the former police chief. He was then immediately fired — but not before he tried to seek protection from termination.","According to the Fayette Advocate, Mick filed what is commonly known as a “whistleblower protection affidavit” under Ohio law with Fiscal Officer Mavis Yourchuck a week ago. On Monday night, he filed the same document with the mayor, police chief, and council vice president, Gregg Shaw.","“Pursuant to the Whistleblower Protection Act of Ohio and Revised Code 4113.52, let this serve as my notification that I believe felonies are being committed by New Holland Mayor Clair ‘Butch’ Betzko and New Holland Village Marshal David Conrad,” read the affidavit. “Pursuant to R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a), this is my complaint. The village and its administration are hereby put on notice that you are barred from seeking retaliatory measures against me, including but not limited to:","● Removing or suspending the employee from employment;
● Withholding from the employee salary increases or employee benefits to which the employee is otherwise entitled;
● Transferring or reassigning the employee;
● Denying the employee a promotion that otherwise would have been received;
● Reducing the employee in pay or position.”","After Mick discovered forgery crimes within the department, he obtained a search warrant and carried it out on Saturday. With the help of the Ohio Highway Patrol and the Pickaway County Sheriff’s office, Mick raided the department.","“For an officer to investigate his own boss when he has probable cause and evidence of a crime being committed is perhaps the most commendable act of all,” said criminal defense attorney Brad Jones of Mick’s bravery to cross the thin blue line. “This officer clearly takes his oath of office seriously and any law enforcement officer who cannot respect that should not have a badge or gun.”","“On July 18, 2018, it was brought to my attention that a paper FAXED to the Ohio Attorney General’s office by the Village of New Holland might be a forged document,” Mick wrote on the request for a warrant. “The form was dated for July 16, 2018 as being signed by Jason Lawless, however, Jason Lawless was believed to be in the state of Alabama on that date and not present in the State of Ohio.”","After Mick compared the form to a dozen other documents, he determined that the signature was forged.",,"During the execution of the search warrant, the mayor showed up and attempted to go inside the department. However, police had set up a perimeter and refused to allow him in.","After finding evidence of the felony forgery during the raid, Mick served a felony summons to Mayor Clair “Butch” Betzko and Police Chief David Conrad during a town hall meeting on Monday.","As Mick handed Conrad his summons, he was immediately given a termination letter — with no cited cause for his firing.","Mick then reportedly walked into the lobby and said, “Just so you know, people, if you do the right think around here, you get terminated.”",The crowd immediately began calling for the termination of the mayor.,"Because Mick filed this affidavit before he was fired, according to the Spitz law firm, he has grounds for a lawsuit and could be reinstated before the end of the week.","“If they have followed the proper protocols and successfully navigated the legal channels, whistleblowers in Ohio have legal recourse for retaliatory actions taken against them as a result of their whistleblowing,” says Cincinnati attorney Robert A. Klingler.","However, this has yet to happen. Mick, like many other good cops before him is experiencing the wrath of the thin blue line. Those good cops who have the courage to cross it often end up punished, fired, or worse.","Just this week, TFTP reported on the case of Former DeLand Police Officer Allison Bainbridge who reported a fellow cop for threatening and abusing an innocent citizen. She had the abuse recorded on her body camera yet she was fired and not the offending cop.",,"

An innocent grandma was imprisoned for months because cops mistook a half eaten bag of cotton candy in her car for meth and didn't believe her when she told them what it was.,"Monroe County, GA — An innocent grandma, Dasha Fincher, was kidnapped by police and thrown in a cage for months—not because she did anything wrong—but because police couldn’t tell the difference between cotton candy and meth. Now, this innocent new grandma is going after the police who did this to her as well as the company who manufacturers the dangerously inaccurate tests cops used to take her freedom.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","This horror movie for Fincher started back on New Year’s Eve of 2016, a day this innocent mother and new grandmother says she’ll never forget.","“Then they found the cotton candy in the floorboard of the car,” said Fincher.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","As the video shows, the bag police claimed was meth was an obvious bag used to hold cotton candy. It looked nothing like the zip lock bags or other tiny bags meth is usually found in. It would be like a cocaine dealer selling coke from a purple Crown Royal bag.","The cotton candy was blue as well which is atypical because real meth is clear or white and only drug dealers looking to be like Breaking Bad add blue tint to their product, which is highly uncommon.","Still, however, this innocent grandma to be was accused of trafficking a large quantity of blue meth, in a cotton candy bag, that looked like cotton candy.","As Fincher noted, Deputy Cody Maples and Deputy Kevin Williams asked her what was in the bag. When she told them it was cotton candy, they did not believe her. According to the incident report, these expert drug recognition officers claimed that “based on the packaging and crystal like feature, Corporal Williams tested the substance.”","The officers then used the highly faulty field test kits which have been known to produce false positives—repeatedly. Predictably, the cotton candy falsely tested positive for drugs.",Fincher then became one of many women and men to suffer horrific fates at the hands of negligent cops and their continued use of faulty field drug test kits.,"In fact, tens of thousands have been convicted and served time — even earning the black mark of a felony — for crimes they likely didn’t commit, according to a report, because the cases against them relied on horribly unreliable field drug test kits.","So prone to errors are the tests, courts won’t allow their submission as evidence. However, their continued use by law enforcement — coupled with a 90 percent rate at which drug cases are resolved through equally dubious plea deals — needlessly ruins thousands of lives.",Dasha Fincher is one of these people.,"As WMAZ reports, this innocent grandma was put in jail for more than three months. Fincher says a judge set her bond at $1 million. In March 22, 2017, GBI lab tests came back to said there were “no controlled substances confirmed in the sample.”","While in jail, Fincher’s daughter miscarried a baby and could not be comforted by her mother. Also, Fincher missed the birth of her twin grandsons.","“My daughter had a miscarriage. I wasn’t there for that. My twin grandsons were born. I missed that,” said Fincher.","“I want Monroe County to pay for they did to me,” said Fincher. However, if history is indicator, the only people to pay for locking up an innocent grandma for cotton candy will be the taxpayers.",,"Sadly, Fincher’s story is extremely common and happens every day throughout the US. The standard $2 field drug tests, manufactured by The Safariland Group, have been proven to be unreliable. And according to the manufacturer, should not be used as a stand-alone test for convictions related to drug possession.","Studies have shown how everyday foods, spices, and medicine tested positive in field drug tests. In one experiment, scientists even discovered that air could set off false positive for these tests.",According to Forensic Resources:,"“The director of a lab recognized by the International Association of Chiefs of Police for forensic science excellence has called field drug testing kits “totally useless” due to the possibility of false positives. In laboratory experiments, at least two brands of field testing kits have been shown to produce false positives in tests of Mucinex, chocolate, aspirin, chocolate, and oregano.”","Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, a Ph.D. chemist and former FBI lab supervisor, has also voiced objections, saying that he has “no confidence at all in those test kits.”","According to the national litigation and public policy organization, the Innocence Project, at any given time there are an estimated 40,000 to 100,000 innocent people currently locked in a cage in U.S. prisons.","Over the years, The Free Thought Project has reported on countless stories of odd things creating false positives in field drug tests.

An innocent grandpa was gunned down in his own home by police after he'd just stopped a maniac who had broken in and was literally trying to eat his grandson.,"Aurora, CO — Richard “Gary” Black Jr. had just successfully stopped every grandparent’s worst nightmare—a maniac home invader attacking your small grandchild—when police arrived at his house and killed him. Now, months after this innocent grandfather was gunned down for defending himself against a maniac in his own home, the officer who killed him will not face charges.","Officer Drew Limbaugh shot and killed Black, 73, on July 30 after Black grabbed a pistol and successfully defended his grandson against Dajon Harper, who had broken into the Black residence and began attacking the 11-year-old child.","Chad Hayashi, the boy’s father and Black’s stepson said that he woke up that morning to a woman standing in his doorway.","“She starts saying to me, ‘My son is on drugs and he has your baby,’” Hayashi said.",Hayashi ran to the bathroom where his son was screaming and found Harper attacking him.,"“He’s naked and wet and has my son in a choke-hold with his right arm and biting my son’s left ear,” Hayashi told ABC News. “My son was covered in blood. I jumped on him and got him to release eventually.”",Hayashi said Harper then attacked Black who used his pistol to shoot the intruder in his bathroom.,"“My dad exited the bathroom, went around the corner, and I immediately heard multiple shots, which I thought was my dad engaging these other people in the house,” Hayashi said.","Those shots were not fired from Black’s gun, however. They were fired from Limbaugh’s gun at Black.","“There was a pause, and then I hear people start screaming, ‘Police!’ and I hear people enter the house. And my son starts screaming, ‘I’m here with my dad. This crazy guy tried to attack me.’”",Police arrived at the residence at 1:30 a.m. and they encountered Black who was holding a gun and a flashlight. This interaction was captured on Limbaugh’s body camera.,"As the video shows, Black is looking around the home, holding a flashlight in one hand and a pistol in the other. Limbaugh yells at the 73-year-old to drop the gun, but it is clear that Black cannot hear him.","As Black continues looking around his home to make sure there were no other intruders, Limbaugh yells once more. Again, Black did not hear him. At no time did Black ever raise the pistol above his waist or point it in the direction of the officers.","Yet still, Limbaugh’s fear took over and he needlessly fired three shots into the innocent grandpa.

"Fairfax County, Virginia – Earlier this year, dash cam footage was released that shows police shooting and killing an unarmed man they claimed was responsible for a hit-and-run. However, the man was actually the victim of a traffic accident and the video shows that he then became the victim of murder by police.","It’s been a nearly a year since the shooting death of Bijan Ghaisar and the FBI, the Justice Department and Park Police have not given a single reason for the use of deadly force — a fact the parents of Ghaisar find “maddening,” according to FOX 5.","“This is very heartbreaking,” said James Ghaisar, Bijan’s father. “I cannot tell you how many times a day literally I am crying. At work, I kind of try to focus and distract myself. But in my car, I am only thinking of him – that I cannot see him, and on top of that – this total silence.”","James and his wife Kelly Ghaisar have done everything they can to try to get answers as to why their son was killed that night. As TFTP reported last month, they filed a lawsuit and now, the taxpayers could be held liable to the tune of $25 million.","“It’s been nothing but stonewalling,” said Bijan’s mother. “We haven’t had anyone who has been actually working on this case, involved on this case, to actually shed any light to us – as if we have no rights.”","After being tight lipped for nearly a year on the incident, only the police report has been released, backing up the victim’s parents’ claims that their son was unarmed when he was gunned down by police.","Ghaisar, 25, died 10 days after he was shot in the head four times by U.S. Park Police, according to the family.","The Free Thought Project reported on the fact that no gun was found in the original investigation, but Ghaisar family’s lawyers released police reports Monday provided by Fairfax County, including a report confirming Ghaisar was unarmed. This report did not come out until investigators literally scanned every inch of the scene with metal detectors in an attempt to justify the shooting.","“The release of the tape and the recent documents by the Fairfax County Police Department were very helpful to answer all those questions,” said James Ghaisar. “So here we are. This is a unique case as far as I am concerned. Bijan could have been anybody’s kid – literally. We raised our kid so proudly.”","The incident began on Nov. 17, 2017, when Ghaisar was rear-ended by an Uber driver, and although he was the victim of the accident, he left the scene.","The accident was reported to the Fairfax Country Police and they treated it as a suspected “hit-and-run.” The McLean Patch reported that when police located Ghaisar’s car, they attempted to pull it over twice and “both times two officers appeared to approach Ghaisar’s car with weapons drawn before he drove away.”","While police have attempted to paint this situation as one in which officers were chasing a dangerous suspect who was putting their lives at risk by evading their attempts to arrest him, Ghaisar’s family told a very different story.","“Bijan Ghaisar was repeatedly threatened by over-aggressive and out-of-control law enforcement officers after he drove away from a minor traffic incident in which he was the victim and in which there was little property damage and no known injuries,” the family told NBC Washington in a statement.","While an armed Park Police officer can be seen banging on the window of Ghaisar’s car, it is also not clear what directions the officers were giving him at the time.","However, it is clear that the officers were becoming increasingly frustrated with Ghaisar. He continued to drive away and was followed by both Fairfax County and U.S. Park Police officers. When Ghaisar stopped at a stop sign, a police cruiser pulled in front of his car to block it, and two officers approached him with guns drawn.","As Ghaisar’s vehicle began to move forward once again, two of the U.S. Park Police officers fired nine shots into his vehicle—four of which struck him in the head. Ghaisar was taken to the hospital where doctors determined that he had suffered severe brain damage, and he was pronounced dead 10 days later.","At the time, Fairfax County Police Chief Ed Roessler released a statement announcing that the FBI is currently investigating the shooting, and the dash cam footage was released to increase transparency.","“As a matter of transparency to all in our community, especially the Ghaisar family, and as the administrative custodian of the video, I am releasing the in-car video of the U.S. Park Police shooting,” Roessler said. “The video does not provide all the answers. However, we should all have confidence in the FBI’s investigation of this matter as I know it will be thorough, objective and professional.”","Once the FBI took over the case, however, no other information was released and authorities have refused to comment.","The McLean Patch noted that “Park Police wouldn’t comment on why there was a pursuit for a car that had been rear-ended in the first place,” and that after reviewing the evidence, a lawyer told the Ghaisar family that “it is even more clear that the killing of Bijan Ghaisar was completely unnecessary” given the original crash.","Bijan Ghaisar was an accountant, a resident of McLean, and he graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University.",The two U.S. Park Police officers who are responsible for the shooting have since gone back to work after a brief paid vacation and no word of any discipline has been released.,"“It’s like an everyday nightmare that goes through our head, and of course it is so obvious that this shouldn’t have been,” said Kelly Ghaisar. “We don’t know why they are keeping this going on so long. This is so cruel that the fact this happened to Bijan.”",,Watch the dash cam footage from the shooting:,,"

"A cop has been fired after he claimed he was ""trigger happy"" and admitted that if he shoots someone he ""makes a ton in overtime.""","Hartford, CT — (RT) A Connecticut police officer who warned suspected trespassers not to run because he felt “trigger happy” has been fired from the force after video footage revealed him saying that he gets paid overtime if he shoots someone.",Hartford police officer Stephen Barone was involved in what appeared to be a routine incident last August in which he stopped a group of males suspected of trespassing on private property. But things took a sinister turn when Barone was also heard boasting that if he shot someone he would be paid overtime.,"Barone’s conduct was called into question when footage of the incident also showed him warning the suspects that he was “trigger happy.” Officer Barone has now been relieved of his duties, Hartford chief of police David Rosado confirmed.","In a statement, Rosado suggested the 10-year veteran had tarnished the police department’s relationship with the community.","“Every day, the men and women of the Hartford Police Department are out doing good police work with professionalism and respect, and this officer’s conduct does not reflect the values of our agency,” Rosado said.","In the three-minute video, which appeared on social media last August, officer Barone can be seen attempting to solve a potential case of trespassing. The cop asks the men if they have any drugs or weapons and then also warns them not to run because he is “trigger happy.”","“If anybody wants to fight or run, I’m a little trigger-happy guys, I’m not gonna lie. And I get paid a ton of money in overtime if I have to shoot somebody. So don’t do anything stupid,” Barone said during the incident. At the time one of suspects described the incident as “spooky”.

"A deeply disturbing video was uploaded to Facebook this week, showing NYPD officers rip a tiny baby from his mother's arms over a dispute on where to sit.","New York, NY — Jazmine Headley and her one-year-old son waited in a Brooklyn public assistance office last Friday for two hours in an attempt to receive some aid. That aid would never come, however, as an appalling video shows, police would show up, rip Headley’s baby from her arms and then arrest the mother.","According to the woman who took the video, Nyashia Ferguson, Headley hadn’t done anything wrong and the entire incident was over nothing.","As Ferguson explained in the video she posted to her Facebook account, when Headley was at the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program office in Boerum Hill last Friday, the crowd was larger than usual and there were no chairs available.","Because she had such a long wait to see an aid worker, Headley simply sat on the floor to wait it out. But a security guard in the office apparently didn’t like this mother sitting on the floor, according to Ferguson. So, she called police, Ferguson wrote on the post.",As the NY Times points out:,"A female security guard eventually approached Ms. Headley, and several more guards followed as a verbal dispute escalated. Ms. Ferguson said they taunted Ms. Headley and laughed in her face before leaving.","Ten minutes later, they returned with the police, Ms. Ferguson said. A fearful expression crossed Ms. Headley’s face as they approached, she said.","Ferguson said Headley tried to tell the officers her side of the story, but they weren’t hearing it and this created a chaotic situation.","“The baby was screaming for his life,” said Ferguson. “The lady was begging for them to get off of her. I was scared.”","Three cops show up first, who then surround Headley and attempt to pull the baby from this mother’s arms. Then, another officer, with their back to the camera, moves in with an apparent mission to separate the baby from his mother.",“They’re hurting my son! They’re hurting my son!” Headley is heard screaming in the video.,"The NYPD officer then begins violently yanking at the baby as onlookers watch in sheer horror. Eventually, the officers over power the mother and get the baby away. At this point, Headley—like any parent who just had their baby torn from their arms would do—became angry, so she was threatened with a taser in her face. She was then handcuffed and arrested.","The NYPD called the incident “troubling” and then blamed Headley for causing it. They said that when officers arrived, after the 911 call, Headley refused to leave.","Because she had been there for 2 hours waiting for help, naturally, anyone would be apprehensive about simply walking out. After refusing to leave, the NYPD says that security guards then “brought the woman to the floor” and police arrested her.","Ferguson disputes the police account of the incident, however, and noted that it was a police officer who waved a stun gun and then forced Headley to the ground.","“They’re always rude,” Ferguson said about the guards in an interview with the NY Times. “They think that people that are poor don’t have nothing, so you can treat them any kind of way.”","The police “didn’t help at all,” she said. “They made it way worse.”",As the NY Times reports:,"Ms. Headley was charged with resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child, obstructing governmental administration and trespassing. The police said she refused medical treatment for herself and her son, who was placed in the care of a relative.","She could not be reached for comment on Sunday because she was being held without bail on Rikers Island, according to online corrections records and Brooklyn Defender Services, the public defender organization representing her.","Deputy Commissioner Phillip Walzak, a police spokesman, said the officers involved are all assigned to the 84th Precinct and remained on full-duty status. He declined to give their names or say whether they followed department protocols, citing its investigation.","The department is investigating the incident with the city Human Resources Administration, which administers public benefits.

"Disturbing video shows four cops hold a man down, threaten a crowd with a taser and then use that taser to smash the non-resisting man's face in.","Louisville, KY — The Louisville Metro Police are in the spotlight this week after a citizen’s video was uploaded to social media showing an officer pound a man’s face in with his taser, as his fellow officers hold him down during an arrest.","According to police, they were responding to an alleged fight outside the Nowhere Bar in Louisville early Sunday morning when they encountered Matthew Murphy. Police claim Murphy attacked them and they had no other choice but to engage. The video does not show this attack.","What the video does show, however, is Murphy on the ground, entirely submissive and not resisting when he is smacked in the face with the officer’s taser as the other officers hold him down.","As the video shows, Murphy is on the ground as one of the four officers on top of him aims his taser into the crowd of bystanders. Shortly after pointing his taser at the crowd, the officer then wallops Murphy with it, causing the crowd to erupt in outrage.",At no time did Murphy appear to be resisting in the video. He merely appears to lift up his head just before being hit.,As WDRB reports:,"The video is being widely shared on social media, with many people claiming the officer used excessive force on Murphy after he had already been handcuffed and was no longer resisting. It is difficult to tell in the video when Murphy was handcuffed.",The video does not show the beginning of Murphy’s encounter with police.,"The arrest citation says off-duty police were flagged down because of a fight and Murphy attacked officers, “striking, kicking, squeezing” and “causing great alarm.” A detective was “forced” to fight Murphy “in the middle of the street” because of his actions, according to the arrest report.","Murphy also grabbed a detective in the groin and “twisted causing pain,” according to the report.","Dwight Mitchell, a spokesman for LMPD, said police are aware of the video and it is under administrative review. Mitchell declined to provide any other information.","Sunday morning Murphy was arrested and charged with numerous charges all stemming from his police interaction. He is facing two counts of assaulting police, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct.",The second assault charge comes after Murphy was accused of spitting on an officer while being transported to the hospital.,"Murphy is currently still in jail being held on a massive $25,000 bond.","If Murphy is guilty of the crimes of which he stands accused, he most assuredly deserves to be held accountable. Unfortunately, however, even if he is proven to be guilty, because the officers held him down while another hit him in the face with a taser while he did not appear to resist—which was captured on video—the taxpayers of Louisville will also likely be held accountable.","The LMPD is no stranger to controversy, or framing innocent men for crimes they did not commit. As TFTP reported earlier this year, three innocent men were released from prison after serving a combined total of more than 50 years for crimes they did not commit, and they all have one thing in common—a homicide detective within the LMPD.","Edwin Chandler spent nine years in prison after he was convicted of shooting and killing store clerk Brenda Whitfield during a robbery in 1993. However, he was exonerated in 2010 after it was determined that another man, who was already serving 20 years on an unrelated assault charge, was responsible for the robbery and the murder.","Chandler sued the city of Louisville and the police department and received $8.5 million in damages. However, the officer who he blames for forcing him to give a false confession faced no repercussions.","

"In their quest to catch people driving on cannabis, police are using tests that can't even detect how much cannabis a person has consumed.","The Massachusetts State Police are testing a new saliva swab to detect if people are driving under the influence of cannabis. State police have recently tested roughly 170 people at sobriety checkpoints and drug treatment clinics with these swabs, but even they doubt that the tests will hold up in court.","Boston is not alone either—there have also been similar programs announced in Colorado, California, Kansas, and Michigan.",State police Maj. Rick Ball told the Boston Herald that police don’t yet have technology comparable to a breathalyzer for cannabis.,"“We’re hoping the technology catches up and, similar to the Breathalyzer comes up with some way for us to detect if somebody is under the influence of marijuana. The goal is to maintain safe roadways,” Ball said.","One of the main problems with the cotton swabs currently in use, is the fact that they merely test for the presence of drugs, but cannot detect how much the person has consumed or if they are impaired.","Attorney Thomas Merrigan pointed out that until the science catches up, these types of tests will run into problems in court.","“This is no slam-dunk. It has a very long road ahead. This is a huge constitutional search-and-seizure issue that needs to also overcome proof of scientific reliability,” Merrigan said.","It is strange that there is such an obsession with busting people for driving with cannabis in their system, especially in states where it is recognized as a medicine that people can get a prescription for. Every single day millions of people drive around with drugs like Xanax and Percocet in their systems and no one thinks twice about it.","Despite this hysteria, driving on cannabis is way safer than driving on alcohol or many prescription pharmaceuticals.","In a recent study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, driving with cannabis in your system is not very dangerous at all. In the study, the Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers, researchers said they found no evidence that being under the influence of cannabis increased a person’s risk of getting into a car accident.","Despite the significant evidence that cannabis is not harmful and actually has medical benefits, the propaganda that helped politicians outlaw the plant in the first place is still deeply ingrained in the minds of the masses—especially the police.","According to a recent report from the Nevada Department of Public Safety, deaths from traffic accidents in Nevada dropped by over 10 percent in the first year that marijuana was legalized in the state for recreational use.","Prior to legalization in Nevada, between July 2016 and May 2017, 310 people died in traffic accidents. But in the year since legalization took effect, between July 2017 and May 2018, that number was reduced to just 277.",Similar numbers have been seen in other states that have implemented legalization. A study published by the American Public Health Association found that states with legal medical cannabis have lower rates of traffic fatalities than states with full prohibition.,"Although correlation does not automatically equal causation, it does seem that legalization is actually making the roads safer, debunking many of the claims that DUI would increase. Critics of marijuana typically cite statistics of how often people test positive for marijuana after car crashes. However, what these assessments usually leave out is the fact that these people often have numerous other drugs in their system, usually alcohol or opiates, which both have a much greater impact on motor skills.","

"For shooting his taser out of the window of his police cruiser and striking an 8th grader riding on an ATV, a cop is on trial for murder.","It took nearly nine months and several petitions by the Detroit Free Press until Michigan State Police (MSP) and Detroit Police allowed the body camera and dash camera footage to be released showing the minutes leading up to and the hours following the tasing murder of Damon Grimes by MSP Trooper Mark Bessner. The 16 hours of recordings show the horror, outrage, and insensitive comments made by many officers on the scene. One video even recorded the moment of his death. Now, Bessner is finally on trial for his actions.","On Monday, a jury was seated in Wayne County Circuit Court to hear the case against Bessner who is charged with second-degree murder for tasering the teen on the ATV.","As TFTP reported, Bessner attempted to force Grimes to pull his ATV off of the road by shooting his taser at him. The thoughtless plan backfired when Grimes apparently seized and slammed into the back of a parked pickup truck—killing him.",Bessner’s lawyer says he was forced to make a split-second decision when Grimes refused to stop the ATV.,The August 2017 killing of the rising 9th grader stunned not only the community but Grimes’ family who immediately began calling for justice. They also filed a $50 million lawsuit against the Michigan State Police and demanded an inquiry into the death of their beloved family member.,Bessner radioed in the incident. He said:,"Give us priority…Chasing an ATV east on Rossini from Reno. It’s a red quad. Black male, black shirt…He’s got a pulse, and he’s breathing. He’s unconscious…He slowed down. We tased him, and he crashed out.","Grimes was riding an all-terrain vehicle on the street when Bessner, sitting as a passenger in the MSP squad car, fired his taser through the passenger window hitting Grimes who then presumably lost control of his ATV and slammed into the back of a parked pickup truck.","Grimes was killed as a result of the traumatic brain injury he sustained during the crash. However, he did have a pulse for some time after the accident, but died on the scene and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.","In the video compiled by the Detroit Free Press, some officers voiced insensitivity and others outrage during the teenager’s final dying moments. One officer, Detroit Police officer Kimberly Buckner can be heard saying, “His pulse is weakening because he was on that fuckin’ thing,” after one officer radioed the uncertainty of whether or not Grimes had a pulse any longer.","Another officer reported to Buckner what the MSP Trooper (Bessner) had done to the boy, implying the horrific nature of their actions. He told her, “They fuckin’ tased his ass while he was cruisin’.”","Other officers were not so understanding and failed to realize Grimes had just finished the 8th grade. An officer told Buckner, “That’s a grown-ass man,” he said of Grimes, who was a 6-foot-1, 234-pound teenager. She corrected him saying, “No, he’s 15…. He’s 15 years old.” The male officer remarked with what seems to be heartless indifference and disassociation. He said:","He’s a bad-ass 15…No sympathy at all for bullshit. Motherfucker wanna be grown, ya act grown, you gotta fuckin’ deal with it.","Hardly an adult, Grimes was likely expected to make mistakes by the community and his family. Little did he likely suspect a cavalier rogue cop would attempt to tase him as he rode his ATV through the streets. There was some indication Grimes did not even know he was being pursued by the Michigan State troopers. The footage seems to indicate the patrol car’s emergency lights were not even on at the time he was tased.",Another reportedly insensitive comment made by a male officer serves to illustrate the us vs. the public mentality some cops who were on the scene apparently possess. He said:,"Buckner continued to be the voice of reason among the police officers. She can be heard whispering to fellow cops, “They tased his ass while he was driving…causing him to flip and crash.”","Tasing anyone from a moving vehicle is a violation of Michigan State Police policy. As a result, county prosecutor Kym Worthy charged Bessner with murder.","As one member of the community remarked in the days and weeks following the boy’s murder, “two mistakes were made that day.” It’s true, Grimes should not have been riding his bike on the road. And it’s also true Bessner should never have thought about deploying his taser from one moving vehicle to attempt to strike another person on another moving vehicle.","One action was a misdemeanor. The other was a felony, allegedly committed by a man who should have been better trained, more understanding, and looking out for the safety of his 8th grade suspect. Either way, it’s a senseless tragedy which could have been avoided.",Bessner now faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted.,,"

"On January 1, 2017, the state of Missouri will implement a public school policy sure to accelerate the descent into police state dystopia.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","The Hazelwood School District put out a memo to parents and guardians stating that, according to Missouri statute, fights at school or on buses will be treated as felonies — which can result in up to four years of prison, fines or probation.","Gone are the days when teachers broke up fights and sent the kids home, calling the parents and perhaps suspending the kid if it was a serious incident. “School Resource Officers” or local cops now arrest the kids and, if there is any perceived injury (an arbitrary judgment), will charge them with third-degree assault – treating children cooped up in school as if they are violent adults on the streets.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","It doesn’t stop there. Even attempts or threats to cause harm will be treated as a Class A misdemeanor, which can bring up to a year of prison time. If the assaulted person is considered a “special victim,” a Class D felony can be imposed which can mean up to seven years in prison.","The Free Thought Project has reported on numerous examples of how public schools are increasingly relying on armed cops to carry out discipline, thereby criminalizing the age-old reality of children behaving badly.",This has resulted in the increasingly prevalent phenomenon known as the “school to prison pipeline.”,"The Arizona State Law Journal found that over the last three decades, there has been a marked shift in public schools to using law enforcement instead of school administrators and teachers for students violating school rules.","Approximately 260,000 students were referred to law enforcement during the 2011-2012 school year, and about 92,000 students were arrested on school property. Unsurprisingly, these numbers affect disadvantaged minority students the most.","The Center for Public Integrity (CPI) documented disturbing examples of children being subjected to law enforcement, just as a shocking video emerged of a cop brutalizing a teenage girl in the classroom for misbehaving.","”Some police actions involve alarming physical altercations, with kids subdued and handcuffed. Others may be handled without much force. But law-enforcement involvement in school discipline has routinely resulted in kids—some as young as elementary school-age—summoned to court to answer charges that they committed crimes. Frequently, charges include battery or assault in connection with schoolyard fights or disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace at school —issues that some believe should be handled by school officials, not cops.”","The worst state is Virginia, with a rate of 16 students per 1,000 being referred to law enforcement. One school had a shocking 228 students, most between 11 and 14, that were referred to cops. A 12-year-old girl was charged with obstruction of justice for clenching her fist at a cop. 11-year-old Kayleb Moon-Robinson, who is autistic, was slammed to the floor for walking out of class too early, and then was charged with felony assault on a police officer and disorderly conduct.","Other shocking examples include five- and six-year-olds being handcuffed, arrested and booked into jail for throwing temper tantrums. Dress code violations, tardiness, and even passing gas have all led to students being referred to law enforcement.","CPI describes how early exposure to law enforcement and the “justice system” has a devastating impact on the mental health of children, and makes it more likely they will grow up to live all or part of their lives behind bars.","“…prosecuting kids in court for low-level accusations like disorderly conduct and battery is actually backfiring; kids become stigmatized, develop records and often disengage from school. The risk increases that they’ll progress to more serious trouble, especially if core emotional or mental-health or learning problems go unresolved or inadequately treated.”","The Arizona State Law Journal confirmed that incarceration increases delinquency and future involvement in the justice system, and “the official processing of a juvenile law violation may be the least effective means of rehabilitating juvenile offenders.”","“No one should underestimate the negative consequences associated with incarcerating a juvenile, both to our society as a whole and to the youth themselves, which is the end result of the school-to-prison pipeline. Empirical research demonstrates that incarceration produces long-term detrimental effects on youth, including reinforcement of violent attitudes and behaviors; more limited educational, employment, military, and housing opportunities; an increased likelihood of not graduating from high school; mental health concerns; and increased future involvement in the criminal justice system.”","By enacting their draconian new rules, the state of Missouri is completely ignoring science, instead, falling back on uniformed state agents with badges and guns – trained to confront the worst of society – to deal with misbehaving kids in school.",Missouri is ignoring the proven benefits of “restorative justice.”,"“Thus, rather than excluding the student from the school community for misbehaving, which potentially can cause resentment, disrupt that student’s educational progress, and lead to recidivism and dropping out of school, one of the primary goals of restorative justice is to integrate the offender back into the school community as a productive member.","In essence, restorative justice practices are conflict resolution tools that involve victims, offenders, and other members of the school community. Using formal and informal conferences, or “circle groups,” victims share with offenders how they have been harmed by the offender’s behavior, offenders have opportunities to apologize to the victims, and, with the help of the victims and the other members of the school community, conference participants devise remedies for the harmful behavior.”","Instead of smart approaches like restorative justice, Missouri is set to plunge its children into a police state nightmare — guaranteeing a long-term rise in prison population and further destroying the mental health of the most vulnerable individuals.","

An innocent mother and her three children are now homeless just before Christmas after police destroyed their home looking for a suspect who was not there.,"Buena Vista Twp, MI — If police think there is a bad guy in your home, they can and smash out windows, kick in doors, and even rip walls completely off. Even when this alleged bad guy is not in the home, police can and will destroy it anyway. Crystal Thomas just learned this fact the hard way—and just before Christmas, she is now homeless.","Last Friday, police executed a search warrant at Thomas’ home looking for her 16-year-old son who was suspected of robbing a store. The execution of the search warrant consisted of smashing in all the windows, tearing off doors, kicking in window units, ripping walls off, and destroying furniture. Cops even smashed the basketball goal outside the home—just for good measure.","“They made sure I could not live in my home,” said Thomas, who is now homeless along with her three other children.","Thomas said when police notified her of the search warrant and detained her on her way home, she offered to cooperate fully, going so far as to offer them a key. She explained to the officers that she had not seen her son since he became defiant.","“I cooperated with them to the fullest while I was detained,” she said. “My son called my phone several times while I was detained and they told me to answer it the last time he called.”","When her son called, Thomas told him to turn himself in and she offered to let police into her home to show them he was not there.","“They got the same info from me and my kids,” she said.","Even though Thomas and all of her children told the SWAT team that her son was not in the house, officer safety trumped logic and reason—and, apparently, a roof over a family’s head.","“They said they can’t do it like this because there are precautions,” she said. “I didn’t know the precautions would be all of this.”",The “precautions” consisted of all but tearing the home completely down and then sending in a robot to find that no one was in the home. It looked like a tornado had come through.,"“They sent the robot in after they tore up the house,” Thomas said to mLive.com, tearfully. “They could’ve sent the robot first.”","Now, as Thomas struggles to find a place to live just before Christmas, police tell her that it is up to her to try and recover her losses.","“The owner can file a claim with the insurance company and the insurance company goes through the state administrator,” MSP Lt. David Kaiser said. “The owner has already been in contact and is working with the state police and insurance company.”","Kaiser called the incident unfortunate, “especially with the holidays coming.”","“It’s not her fault that her son made some bad decisions,” Kaiser said, ignoring the fact that it was police who destroyed her home not her son.","Sadly, police destroying homes looking for non-existent suspects happens more than people think. As TFTP previously reported, Cherokee County Sheriff David Groves and his heroic team of militarized storm troopers descended on the home of a single mom and her five kids in Galena, Kansas just before Christmas in 2015.","Upon removing the mother and her five children from the house, police entered into a 20-hour-long standoff — with the empty house.","After not breaking things or killing anyone for 19 hours, the officers became restless, said to hell with the Sheriff’s strategy of waiting for him to come out, and proceeded to storm the home.","A SWAT truck with a battering ram attached was used to poke holes and tear apart the house in an attempt to drive the nonexistent suspect out. As deputies became unable to find him, they began taking their frustration out on couches, beds, lamps, clothing, toys, and even the family’s Christmas tree was ripped through a window and smashed to bits.","Just like Thomas, the entire time, Nita Lane, the homeowner, was trying to tell the cops that the suspect was not there and does not live there. Just like Thomas, police did not listen.","

Disturbing body camera footage was released this week showing Las Vegas police kill a man in need of mental health help for holding a plastic toy sword.,"Las Vegas, NV — The Las Vegas Police Department is in the news again—for killing a citizen—again. This time, their victim was a 44-year-old man holding a plastic toy sword that he had made himself.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","According to police, they received a 911 call from a resident who became fearful of Lloyd Napouk after witnessing him walking through the neighborhood holding the toy.","“We have information in talking with the folks related to him that he had made this device. He called it a sword. He was very proud of it,” Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Charles Hank said at a Tuesday press conference. “He really looked at it as being very special to him.”eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","Napouk was killed by police just after midnight on Saturday. Metro Sgt. Buford Kenton, 36, and officer Cameran Gunn, 29, initiated a five-minute long stand off and then killed the man—for holding the toy sword.","As the video shows, Napouk ignores several commands to drop the object, then the sergeant radios in, “Let’s get a unit with a beanbag shotgun. And can we have K-9 out here and have medical stand by? Call for medical.”","Sadly, however, the officers would not wait for less than lethal options and their fear of a piece of plastic would cause them to kill a man who was in obvious need of mental health help.","“Dude, just drop it,” Kenton yells in the video, as he points his Glock 19 at the man holding a toy sword, as he paces in front of a house. The officers were safely positioned behind a cruiser as they told Napouk to drop the sword. At no time were they ever in any danger.","“It’s not worth it, man,” says Kenton.","At one point, Napouk can be heard in the footage saying, “Get out of here.”","“I’m going to shoot you,” Kenton yells. “If you come one more step, you’re dead.”","Moments later, Kenton made good on his promise and killed the man holding a 22-inch long piece of plastic.",As the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports:,"Kenton fired four rounds about 9 feet away from Napouk, and Gunn fired three from about 11 feet away, Hank said.","Napouk died of multiple gunshot wounds, and his death was ruled a homicide Tuesday by the Clark County coroner’s office.","The suspect’s intentions in the neighborhood were not clear, Hank said. Napouk lived with his girlfriend about a mile away from where he was killed, and he arrived at Tinker Toy Avenue on his bike, Hank said.","Had he survived, Napouk would have faced a charge of resisting a public officer with a deadly weapon, according to Hank. Napouk did not have a criminal history in Clark County, but had prior charges in Alaska and Washington, including DUI, assault, disorderly conduct, criminal mischief and reckless endangerment, Hank said.",Napouk was the 21st citizen to be shot by the LVMPD this year—11 of which were fatal.,,"

"Forced to confirm to a shift in the paradigm on locking people up for marijuana, New York announced they will be dropping thousands of active arrest warrants.","Manhattan, NY — As TFTP reported earlier this year, after multiple district attorneys in the state announced that they will refuse to prosecute people who are arrested for possessing marijuana, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the NYPD to stop arresting people for smoking marijuana in public. Now, however, they have taken it to another level by throwing out thousands of active arrest warrants for marijuana possession.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","In May of this year, the Free Thought Project reported that New York City District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced that his office will refuse to prosecute people for possessing and smoking marijuana. Now, Vance is dropping over 3,000 open marijuana cases dating all the way back to 1978.","Vance noted that this action will serve to address racial disparities in the prosecution of marijuana offenses.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","Vance moved to vacate 3,042 outstanding warrants and dismiss the underlying charges before New York City Criminal Court Judge Kevin McGrath. The judge said the cases must be sealed within 90 days, according to Reuters.","“By vacating these warrants, we are preventing unnecessary future interactions with the criminal justice system,” Vance said in court. “We made the decision that it is really in the interest of justice.”","While this is certainly a step in the right direction, it doesn’t go far enough. It seems that Vance may be simply trying to relieve his office of the burden of prosecuting harmless marijuana smokers and attempting to claim to be the good guy along the way.","According to Reuters, Vance said that dropping all the charges would relieve his office and the court system of a massive burden. However, this move only applies to misdemeanor and violation cases in which a warrant was issued because the defendant failed to appear in court. It does not apply to any cases where a defendant was convicted, or to more serious charges like selling marijuana.","It is important to point out that Vance and de Blasio alike are not the good guys here. However, they are forced to react as the act of kidnapping and caging people for marijuana has become so reprehensible in the public eye that they are the ones who look like criminals—not harmless pot smokers.","They are politicians, moving with the current shift in the paradigm which shuns throwing people in cages for victimless crimes.","“With marijuana legalization likely to occur in our state in the near future, it is critical our city plans for the public safety, health and financial consequences involved. While I still have real concerns we must work through, it isn’t difficult to see where this is headed, and any responsible policymaker must prepare for that eventuality. My focus now will be helping to craft the critical regulatory framework that must come before legalization is realized,” de Blasio said earlier this year, confirming his reaction.","Despite a handful of reefer madness politicians clinging on to their war on marijuana, they are a dying breed. What’s more, legal weed is the answer to so many woes currently facing the country today.","In states where cannabis has been legalized, society has not fallen apart—but has improved in many ways.","In a recently published research study in a peer-reviewed journal, Melvin D. Livingston, Tracey E. Barnett, Chris Delcher, and Alexander C. Wagenaar, it was shown that rates of opiate deaths dropped significantly in states that where cannabis was legalized.",A study published by the American Public Health Association found that states with legal medical cannabis have lower rates of traffic fatalities than states with full prohibition. The researchers analyzed 29 years of data in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System.,Another new study has indicated that the Boston Police Department has drastically increased the number of homicides they solved since they stopped making arrests for marijuana. The homicide clearance rate increased by 10 percent following the decriminalization of marijuana in the area.,The study reviewed every homicide in Boston between 2007 and 2011 and found that the department was hardly spending any time or resources to hunt down murderers. This is not a simple oversight and is obviously due to the fact that police departments don’t have much of a financial incentive to solve murders.,"Although the study does not mention the factors leading to the increase in solved murders, the clearance rate coincides with the decriminalization of marijuana.","As reported by the Denver Post in 2015, Colorado employers added more jobs in June than they had in any single month since official counts began back in 1939. As expected, the population has also grown in Colorado now that there is more freedom and more opportunity. According to the report, since legalization went into effect the average numbers for paychecks are also higher.","With all of this evidence, it becomes clear that legalization actually improves society, as opposed to “creating concerns for public health and safety” as the fearmongering politicians suggest.",The only thing a marijuana user has to fear from using marijuana is the state.,"

Byron also noted that Augustine was not wearing his bulletproof vest, saying, that Augustine “drove for an hour without a vest.”","Instead of being arrested and hauled off to jail, Augustine was simply cited for driving drunk, allowed to go home, and placed on paid vacation—blue privilege indeed.",Lt. Byron gave his fellow cop so much leeway that he even considered letting the drunken “Augie” drive home—after he just drove his police cruiser into a semi-trailer.,"On Wednesday, Augustine pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated, in spite of admitting to drinking and having a .14 BAC.",,"

"A Nashville cop exposed rampant corruption within her own department as well as a police officer who allegedly raped her, and she was attacked for it by her own department. ","Nashville, TN — (RT) A female officer who became a pariah among Nashville police has sued the force and her commander for allegedly retaliating against her after she alleged a rape by a colleague, as well as racial and gender-based discrimination.","Monica Blake, an African-American officer 14 years on the job, has been at odds with her department for a while and her lawsuit includes a long list of grievances, from being treated differently than male colleagues to free speech suppression and retaliation for reporting a rape in 2016.",Monica Blake claimed another Nashville police officer sexually assaulted her; he got diversion in court and Blake said she got discriminated against in the department. https://t.co/TUMyzESwyz,"— Tennessean (@Tennessean) November 17, 2018",,"In April this year the officer who she accused –who went under nickname Hulk– made a plea deal with the District Attorney’s office and had his rape charges reduced to aggravated assault. Blake told local media that the DA’s office explained to her that a top officer in her department told them she was “untruthful.” She had earlier been the subject of an internal probe, which included looking into complaints that she was lying in a child abuse case. The investigation found that she was telling the truth.","But Blakes’ tensions with Metro Nashville Police Department (MNPD) started after a card game, according her lawsuit, a report by the Tennessean suggests.","The woman claims the penalties she received from her supervisors were unjustifiably tough. She recalled that she was once suspended for three days for simply playing a game of cards, while white male officers escaped almost all culpability for much harsher violations – like skipping work to hang out with their buddies or arresting a sober person for driving under influence.","But all of her complaints “fell on deaf ear,” Blake said, adding that the sexual assault charges against the man who was alleged to have raped her were eventually dropped too.","It got worse when she publicly supported an initiative to create a Community Oversight Board, which would impartially investigate police shootings and other misconduct by cops, dedicating several social media posts to the issue.",The officer recently learnt of a closed Facebook group where current and retired police officers teamed up against her and suggested that she should be swiftly sacked from the department.,"“Never thought I would see the day that a Metro Officer would turn against her fellow officers. Wonder, who’s back she is watching, or better yet who is watching hers. What goes around comes around,” one of the comments in the group read.","“For a long time, I lived in fear. I was terrified for a long time,” Blake told News4, adding that she was also verbally attacked by colleagues, who branded her “a traitor.”",The officer said she filed a federal lawsuit against MNPD and Commander Janet Pardue on Friday “to protect me and you. Let citizens of Nashville know this is what’s going on right in your city.”,"“I want justice, and justice at this point, I can’t quite define it but I do know that people need to be held accountable for the things that they have done,” Blake said in an interview with News Channel 5.","The lawsuit also pushes for the Nashville Police to amend their strict social media policy, which now states that service personnel may be subject to “corrective and/or disciplinary action” for online activities viewed as “inappropriate” by MNPD.",The officer claimed the department had also considered suspending her after she recently gave an interview to a website supporting the Community Oversight Board.,"“What hurt me the most is that inclusiveness, in my opinion, is what’s going to help bring us to a better place but with this Code Of Silence it was evident that… officers were more concerned with banding together than they were with the interest of the public and that in and of itself made me question why I am in policing in the first place,” Blake said.",Think your friends would be interested?

A detective assigned to the department's child sex crimes unit—whose job was to help child victims—has been arrested for allegedly raping one of those victims.,"Los Angeles, CA — A disturbing case of police rape has surfaced out of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department this week as a detective assigned to handle victims of child molestation cases was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl. The girl was a victim in a case the officer was investigating and had already been raped by someone else.","Detective Neil Kimball, 45, was assigned to the Special Victims Bureau, a unit tasked with investigation cases of sex crimes against children. Kimball was arrested on Friday on suspicion of rape by force and “preventing or dissuading a witness or victim from testifying,” said Nicole Nishida, spokeswoman for the department’s Internal Criminal Investigations Bureau.","Given the number of victims Kimball has had contact with in the past, this case has caused grave concern at the department. According to the LA Times, Kimball has investigated dozens of child molestation cases in the last 5 years as a member of the elite specialized unit.","“The investigation and arrest resulted from information provided to the department by a member of the public,” the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.",The department kept the arrest on Friday under wraps and made no mention of it until Monday.,Adding to the insidious nature of the case is the fact that this is not the first time Kimball has been accused of sexual misconduct on the job.,"As the LA Times reports, Kimball was investigated previously, after a woman told the Sheriff’s Department in February 2009 that Kimball had grabbed her hand several months earlier and tried to make her touch his genitals, according to a memo from the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. Prosecutors ultimately declined to charge Kimball in the case.",The above allegations were made in 2009 and despite the evidence against him—although it didn’t lead to a conviction—Kimball was allowed to join the special victims unit to deal with child victims of sexual assault.,"When asked why he was allowed to join the unit despite the 2009 allegations, the department said in a statement, according to the Times:",“The prior allegations involving Det. Kimball were presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office and criminal charges were declined due to insufficient evidence. The department will conduct a review of the internal process related to Det. Kimball’s assignment at Special Victims Bureau.”,According to the report in the Times:,"News of the arrest sent a tremor through the ranks of sex crime investigators, who are normally thoroughly vetted before receiving such assignments.","Dan Scott, a retired Sheriff’s Department sergeant in the special victims unit who has investigated hundreds of child sex abuse cases, said of Friday’s arrest: “This is a shock. The unit has never had something like this happen.”","The alleged attack occurred in November 2017 in Ventura County, said Ventura County Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Michael Schwartz, whose office has been involved in the case for the last month. L.A. County sheriff’s internal criminal affairs investigators reached out to the Ventura County office for assistance, officials said.","As of Monday night, Kimball remains in jail on a $2,000,000 bond. He is currently suspended with pay.",,"As TFTP has reported, while independent researchers began tracking how many people are killed by cops every year, no one was tracking how many crimes were committed by cops. However, that is beginning to change, and the data shows that the problem is staggering.","Last year, a study exposed the startling fact that police officers are arrested about 1,100 times a year, or roughly three officers charged every day. Many of these arrests are over unspeakable sex crimes.","“Police crimes are not uncommon,” the study’s lead researcher Philip M. Stinson concluded. “Our data directly contradicts some of the prevailing assumptions and the proposition that only a small group of rotten apples perpetrate the vast majority of police crime.” Although nearly 60 percent of the crimes “occurred when the officer was technically off-duty,” Stinson wrote, “a significant portion of these so-called off-duty crimes also lies within the context of police work and the perpetrator’s role as a police officer, including instances where off-duty officers flash a badge, an official weapon, or otherwise use their power, authority, and the respect afforded to them as a means to commit crime.”","According to a report from WaPo, in cases involving allegations of sexual abuse, 72 percent of the officers were fired, and more than 80 percent resulted in convictions, the study found. There were 422 reported cases of forcible and statutory rape, 352 cases of forcible fondling and 94 sodomy cases over the seven years of the study, which Stinson called “larger than expected based on the existing research.” The data search turned up 174 examples of male officers arrested in cases of “Driving While Female,” in which women drivers were harassed or assaulted. About 82 percent of those cases ended in convictions.","

"In a retaliatory move to the growing list of sanctions placed on Russia by the U.S., the country has announced it will ""get rid of the dollar.""","As the United States continues to pile on an ever-growing list of sanctions on to Russia, the country is fighting back by abandoning the US dollar. Although they have been expressing their desire to break away from the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar and the global dollar-based payment systems for years, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said this week that they are accelerating those efforts, to “get rid of the dollar.”","Over 60 percent of global reserves and 80 percent of global payments are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, according to James Rickards, author of Currency Wars. This gives the U.S. extreme control over other countries’ imports and exports and they are able to force countries into submission using sanctions.","However, those days of global monetary control appear to be coming to an end, especially as other countries aside from Russia abandon U.S. dollar as well.","“Thank God, this is happening, and we will speed up this work,” Ryabkov said, explaining the move would come in addition to other “retaliatory measures” as a response to a growing list of US sanctions. Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak recently noted that a growing number of countries are interested in replacing the dollar as a medium in global oil trades and other transactions, according to RT.","“There is a common understanding that we need to move towards the use of national currencies in our settlements. There is a need for this, as well as the wish of the parties,” Novak said.","This year, the Russian government has also drastically reduced their holdings of United States Treasury bonds, with Russian ownership of U.S. bonds declining from $96.1 billion in March to $48.7 billion in April—and then further reducing their holdings to just $14.9 billion in May; an 11-year low.","As the Free Thought Project has recently reported, Russia has been buying large amounts of gold during its gradual sell-off of U.S. Treasury bonds, and it recently overtook China as the world’s biggest holder of gold with $80.5 billion worth.","The reason gold is so critical is that it cannot be manipulated by U.S.-based economic warfare, as it cannot be frozen out as other forms of digital and paper fiat can be.","Gold can simply be loaded onto pallets and shipped to another state to make a payment, thus bypassing targeted economic sanctions that are currently being used by the United States as a means of attempting to force geopolitical compliance by Russia and other countries. The strategic significance of gold is so great, that even when oil prices and Russian financial reserves were collapsing in 2015, they continued to acquire gold.","Additionally, the U.S. is the only country with veto power at the International Monetary Fund, known as the global lender of last resort. Thus, one of the most crucial weapons wielded by Russia, in its war to free itself from the hegemony of the petrodollar, is gold.","With the petrodollar being utilized as a weapon by the U.S. in a time of increased economic warfare, gold is a clearly a means of bypassing U.S. sanctions.","What’s more, as we previously reported, China has also moved to bypass the U.S. dollar by launching petro-yaun earlier this year.",The Chinese government reportedly plans to allow the crude oil futures contract priced in yuan to be fully convertible into gold.,"As TFTP reported at the time, in addition to serving as a hedging tool for Chinese companies, the contract will allow for increased use of the yuan in trade settlement.","These contracts will thus enable China’s trading partners to pay with gold or to convert yuan into gold without the necessity to keep money in Chinese assets or turn it into US dollars, according to Bloomberg. However, China has already agreed to stop using the dollar in global trade.","Essentially, the new benchmark will allow exporters, such as Russia, Iran or Venezuela to avoid US sanctions by trading oil in yuan that is convertible to gold – thereby negating the hegemony of the petrodollar.","It seems that the U.S. is slowly losing its power to sanction other countries into submission and it is at the expense of your paycheck. As other countries begin to dump the U.S. dollar to avoid being sanctioned by America, an inevitable inflation crisis will ensue and the government’s hubris may bring on a new great depression.","“It is more of a game changer for the US. As soon as other nations have a real credible alternative to the US dollar, they can dump dollars and switch to the yuan which can spark a dollar crisis. If that happens, not only will there be inflation from the tariffs, but also from the flood of dollars,” Ann Lee, Adjunct Professor of Economics and Finance at New York University and author of the book ‘What the US Can Learn From China’, said.","

The lead FBI investigator in the murder of Biggie Smalls has come forward with damning information that exposes a vast conspiracy inside the LAPD and implicates officers in his death.,"Los Angeles, CA — On March 9, 1997, in front of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, Christopher “The Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace was gunned down in a drive-by shooting by an unknown assailant. Since that fateful night, conspiracy theories and controversy has surrounded the case. Now, however, his fans and the rest of the world may have some answers as to what happened as the FBI agent tasked with investigating the murder has come forward with bombshell information.","Former head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, Philip Carson was tasked as the lead investigator in the death of Wallace. Carson said he was very close to exposing Wallace’s killer(s) but his bosses at the FBI shut down his investigation due to pressure from the LAPD.","Carson held this information secret until he retired two years ago and took 3,000 pages of the murder case documents with him to begin telling his story. Carson recounted the details of his story to filmmakers who made an upcoming movie starring Johnny Depp, titled City of Lies.","As the Sun reports, Carson told one of the movie’s producers Don Sikorski that his documents could rock the foundations of LA’s law enforcement, in a tape shared with Sun Online.","“It’s bulls**t and here’s what gets under my skin more than anything,” Carson says in the recording.","“LAPD, all the way to the very very f***ing top, knew exactly what was going on.","“They briefed on certain stuff, I met with them and for them to say anything different – I could prove to you not only how they knew, but how they obstructed this case, and how they completely derailed it.",“It’s hard for me to even explain how amazing it is what they did.”,According to the report in the Sun:,"Carson believes that Marion ‘Suge’ Knight, the former CEO of Death Row Records who signed rappers including Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac, employed the LAPD cops and ordered them to arrange Wallace’s murder.","At the time, Carson’s line manager signed off on his report, but the case was rebuffed by the United States Attorney’s office, allegedly after pressure from the LAPD.",He says senior members of the LAPD then conspired with his bosses at the FBI and prosecutors to keep his evidence secret.,"Carson believes top officials were trying to save the city from bankruptcy after Biggie’s mum Voletta filed a $500,000 lawsuit over her son’s death – and didn’t want him testifying.","“I can prove to you how they not only knew what was going on, but how they obstructed this case, how they derailed it,” said Carson in an interview with the Daily Beast. “I was young enough and naive enough not to realize how big and powerful these people were.”","“I’m glad Phil Carson, whatever’s heavy on his heart, is coming forward and letting the truth be known,” said “Big Gene” Deal, a bodyguard for Sean “Diddy” Combs who witnessed the shooting and met with Carson multiple times as part of the FBI investigation. “Phil was a straight shooter. By him coming out and doing this right here, it makes me feel good.”","Randall Sullivan, who is writing the book on which City of Lies is based, which will be released in 2019, told the sun that “the LAPD was at risk of ceasing to exist, the financial hit [of the lawsuit] was going to be so enormous. There were already preliminary plans for either the sheriff’s department or the federal government to take over the LAPD, because the hit and the legal consequences were going to be enormous.”","David Mack and Rafael Perez, the two rogue LAPD Police Officers who are tied to the murder of Wallace have a history of corruption, up to and including armed robbery.","Both Perez and Mack served time for their corruption and now, according to Sullivan, they could do more.","

A border patrol agent has been acquitted for shooting a 16-year-old boy in the back after he threw some rocks to distract agents.,"TUCSON, Ariz. – (CN) A small, loud protest erupted outside the Evo A. DeConcini Courthouse Wednesday after a federal jury acquitted a U.S. Border Patrol agent of involuntary manslaughter in the 2012 shooting death of a Mexican teenager.","Lonnie Swartz, a two-year veteran agent, opened fire on Oct. 10, 2012 through an urban fence separating the U.S. from Mexico after responding to help other agents who were trying to catch marijuana smugglers. He killed 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, who prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed was throwing rocks to distract the agents. Thirteen bullets hit the boy, all but three from the back.","Richard Boren, a volunteer with the Border Patrol Victims Network, protested often during the 16-day trial and was in front of the courthouse Wednesday. He called the acquittal a travesty of justice that gives other agents the green light to unnecessarily use deadly force.","“These agents are going to continue to use lethal force with impunity, which they’ve always gotten away with,” said Boren before heading toward the courthouse entrance, shouting that President Trump condones shooting rock throwers.",“What level have we stooped to in this country?” he demanded.,"After allowing Boren to speak for a few minutes, Department of Homeland Security officers escorted him to a nearby sidewalk off the courthouse grounds. After he returned twice to the courthouse property, officers led him inside in handcuffs.","This is Swartz’s second trial stemming from the shooting. In April, a different jury acquitted him of second-degree murder, but deadlocked on manslaughter charges, clearing the way for another trial. Jurors did not return a verdict Wednesday on the voluntary manslaughter charge, which could make a third trial possible.",Prosecutors and defense attorneys will discuss a possible third trial at a status conference later this month before U.S. District Judge Raner Collins.,"Art De Cuerto, president of the local chapter of the border patrol union the National Border Patrol Council, called Swartz’s trials “revenge.” He doesn’t think the U.S. Attorney’s office will seek a third trial.","“I think Lonnie Swartz is the victim here,” he said outside the courthouse.","Swartz claimed on the witness stand that he was protecting himself and fellow agents from the rocks, which Elena had been lobbing up and over a 37-foot barrier from about 100 feet away. He was afraid for his life, and followed his training to eliminate the threat, he testified. Swartz said he saw a second gunman, and that’s why he kept shooting after the boy fell.","Prosecutors argued that Swartz was not afraid but angry the night of the shooting, when he walked slowly along a border fence for 34 seconds, shooting into Mexico from the U.S. He fired 16 shots from three positions along the fence, stopping after 13 shots to reload his semi-automatic handgun.","A blood splatter expert testified for the prosecution that the boy was moving after he fell, meaning Swartz executed a helpless teen.","Swartz, who has been on administrative leave since the shooting, quickly left the courthouse with his attorneys after the verdict. His attorneys did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.","Even if prosecutors don’t seek a third criminal trial, Swartz will likely return to court over the shooting. Elena’s mother, Aricceli Rodriguez, sued him, and the Ninth Circuit recently ruled that Swartz’s status as a law enforcement officer does not protect him from lawsuits.",That lawsuit is still pending.,"

"While cleaning up after a party, a woman walked into her kitchen where she was startled by two cops who then demanded her son stop filming them. ","Tate County, MS — Cops in America — who swear an oath to uphold the constitution, which includes free speech — are constantly caught in the act of violating that oath by attacking free speech. A glaring case out of Mississippi backs up this notion as two Tate County sheriff’s deputies barged into an woman’s home uninvited and demanded her son stop filming.","The victim, Cardravious Crump was cleaning up after a Halloween party that was full of clean fun at his mother’s house when the police showed up about an hour later.","“Party went great. No problems, no nothing, no fights, no anything,” Crump told WREG.","As they were cleaning, the deputies — without knocking or even announcing themselves — walk into the house and startled Crump’s mother in the kitchen.","Crump said they mentioned underage drinking even though he said the party had already ended and then said they asked for IDs, according to WHNT.","“I asked him nicely to step out. I said, ‘Well then, I can talk to you, but can you step outside?'” said Crump’s mother, Carla Echols.","However, according to Echols, the deputies refused to leave, a clear violation of their oath to the Fourth Amendment of the constitution. But these cops weren’t done, before they would leave, they’d violate the First Amendment too.","“So I cursed him out. I was like, ‘You gonna get the [expletive] out my house ’cause I did not tell you to come in here,'” she said.","At this point, Crump started filming. Just as soon as he turned on the camera — in his own home — one deputy demanded he turn it off.","“You can turn that off. You can turn that off,” barked the deputy.","Crump did not listen to the officer, knowing full well it is legal to film the police, especially in your own home.","However, Crump resisted the order to stop filming for just under a minute when he says he became fearful of what may happen if he didn’t listen.","“At the moment when he reached around his side, I didn’t know what he was reaching for, so I just stopped recording,” Crump said.","It turned out that the cop wasn’t going to shoot him, but instead handcuff and kidnap him for filming. Luckily, however, having absolutely nothing to charge Crump or his mother with, no one was arrested.","“I felt violated, being in my own home too,” Crump said.",The actions of the officers were so egregious that Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance was forced to release a statement noting this.,"“After a preliminary review of the facebook video, as well as the video from the deputy’s bodycam, I can say that my deputy erred in ordering the individual to turn off his camera,” Lance said in an email. “All citizens have the right to film law enforcement in the performance of their duties except in a very limited set of circumstances.”","The department says they are currently investigating the deputies involved and plan to have more answers in about a day, according to WHNT.",,"As TFTP has reported, it has been clearly established that all Americans have the right to record the police. For an officer of the law to remain willingly ignorant of this precedent is at best, dereliction of duty, and at worst, unlawful deprivation of rights. Either way, these cops were in the wrong.","As the ACLU points out,","Taking photographs and video of things that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right—and that includes transportation facilities, the outside of federal buildings, and police and other government officials carrying out their duties.","Unfortunately, law enforcement officers have been known to ask people to stop taking photographs of public places. Those who fail to comply have sometimes been harassed, detained, and arrested. Other people have ended up in FBI databases for taking innocuous photographs of public places.","The right of citizens to record the police is a critical check and balance. It creates an independent record of what took place in a particular incident, one that is free from accusations of bias, lying, or faulty memory. It is no accident that some of the most high-profile cases of police misconduct have involved video and audio records.","When police refuse to have their public service documented and this refusal morphs into a violation of their oaths, something has gone seriously wrong. No one should ever face persecution for their first amendment rights—especially in the land of the free.","

Shocking video caught on a bicyclists helmet camera shows a police officer plow into him because he was distracted on his phone. ,"Peculiar, MO — A rather shocking video was uploaded to YouTube this week by a cyclist wearing a helmet camera who filmed a distracted police officer ram him head on as he waited at a stop sign.

Whoa!” Fas screamed as officer Wallace looked down at his phone, clearly not paying attention to where he was going.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","“You mother….motherf**ker, you were looking at your phone, officer,” says Fas as he gets to his feet.","Wallace opens his door and immediately gives the excuse that he was “f**king looking at a text from another officer,” as if this makes plowing over an innocent bicyclist acceptable.","“396,” Fas says, recording to officer’s unit number.

"After a disturbing video captured California deputies savagely attacking a woman for selling flowers without a permit surfaced, a lawsuit was announced. ","Perris, CA — In the Land of the Free, if you do not pay the State before you attempt to sell a product or service to a willing customer, you can and will be extorted, kidnapped and caged, with extreme prejudice. A video published to Facebook backs up this notion, showing a Riverside County Sheriff’s Department deputy assault a woman who was selling flowers on the side of the road — because she apparently failed to pay the State for the privilege. Now, because the deputy’s actions were so egregious, the taxpayers are going to be held liable.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","The victim, Joaquina Valencia, was selling flowers outside of a high school graduation ceremony in Perris last year when the altercation began. Because she was treated like a dog and savagely attacked, Valencia announced a lawsuit this week against the department.","Valencia says in the lawsuit that no human should ever be treated the way she was. “He tossed me like a rag,” Valencia said in an interview with NBC Los Angeles.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","The complaint alleges Valencia was “unjustifiably beaten, shoved to the ground and arrested.”","The video does not tell the entire story. However, it starts as the officer is grabbing a woman who is holding multiple sets of flowers, clearly arranged for sale on the roadside.","As the video begins, the motorcycle officer is grabbing the woman by the arm. The woman, who apparently doesn’t speak English, is clearly terrified.","Not wanting to be assaulted or otherwise extorted by the deputy for selling flowers, the woman pulled her arm back and tried to move away. She was still holding onto her flowers, indicating that she was in no way a threat to the officer.","However, as the woman attempted to move backward, away from the officer, he grabbed her by her hair and attacked her.","Within seconds, the officer had tripped Valencia — who was still trying to protect her flowers as they likely cost her much needed money — and was on top of her.",The video is appalling as the cop kneels down on the woman and shoves his gloved hand over her mouth. The woman begins yelling out in Spanish as another cop joins in on the arrest — all over flowers.,"As the officers roll her over to place the handcuffs on her, we can see just how terrified Valencia is, as she appears to have urinated on herself.","The department justified the arrest, claiming that Valencia gave a fake name (Juanita Mendez-Medrano) when she was detained. However, this had nothing to do with the original stop for selling flowers. And, all charges were eventually dropped against Valencia.","Moreover, Valencia’s attorney Ralph Rios argues that Joaquina Valencia is her true name and that she was just nervous.","“A lot of times when people do that, people get nervous and, she might have said a different name, she might have said something,” Rios said.",Some of the comments on the video are almost as disheartening as the video itself. Multiple people attempted to justify this assault and battery by claiming the woman should’ve had a permit.,Facebook user Chuck N. wrote:,"taxes, it;s called getting a permit, pay taxes, oh and dont resist when officer gives you a ticket. Is that person even in the country legally?","Another FB user, Eady T, wrote:",Selling flowers without a vendor’s license is a crime. Petty but crime non the less. So is resisting arrest. ,"Sadly, Americans are being conditioned to think that in the land of the free, people are somehow morally wrong if they try to make a dollar without first being extorted by the state.","The bottom line is — in modern day police state, USA — exchanging goods and services is a crime unless the State gets their cut. We are told that this is for our safety and that we could all die if a brown woman sells flowers on the corner. But nothing could be further from the truth.",Morality does not equal reality — and the video below is more than enough evidence to prove this.,,"Sadly, this is one of many incidents in which people trying to earn a few bucks have been attacked or otherwise kidnapped by police ‘protecting society.’","In May of last year, the Alameda County Sheriff’s department posted a photo of a deputy arresting a man for selling fruits and vegetables on the roadside and attempted to justify the arrest. When people read the department’s justification, they lashed out — peacefully — to let them know what they were doing is wrong.","The following June, a 38-year-old homeless man was attempting to earn some honest money by providing a much-desired service to the residents of Kennewick, Washington when he was threatened with extortion and arrest by the local police department, which effectively ended his enterprise. After the Kennewick Police Department threatened the homeless man and prevented him from making a living, they took to Facebook to shamelessly brag about it.","

"A woman was diagnosed as 'psychotic' in jail and was then ignored as she screamed for help, and eventually allowed to gouge out her own eyeball and eat it.","Chino, CA — In a testament to the neglect and abuse suffered by inmates at the hands of police, a woman in Chino, California—in dire need of medical attention for a mental health problem—was ignored until she literally ripped out her own eyeball and swallowed it.","Every 15 minutes, for four hours straight, the woman had screaming fits which were ignored repeatedly. This neglect by jail staff was in spite of the fact that the woman was admitted and known to be ‘psychotic.’","After four hours of being ignored, the woman fell to the ground and began pry her eyeball from her skull. She was able to remove the entire eyeball and swallow before the guards paid any attention.","According to the LA Times, ","The woman, identified only as Inmate Patient X in federal court documents, had not been given medication despite being listed as “psychotic” while at the California Institution for Women in Chino in 2017.","A report written by Dr. Michael Golding, the chief psychiatrist for the prison system, detailed the gruesome incident in a report made public last week to highlight how the state allegedly has failed to care for some of its most vulnerable inmates. Golding alleges in the 161-page document that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has concealed issues surrounding the adequacy of mental healthcare and staffing in prisons from officials who could mandate changes.","Detailing the immense depth of the problems within the jail system in Chino, Golding explained that “this group has created a biased and inaccurately positive picture of what is actually a troubled system of care.”","The disturbing part is that the woman was evaluated by a psychologist, deemed psychotic, and then thrown into a cage with everyone else without any help. Had she been administered the proper medication, she may still have her eye today. Golding agrees.","“The tragedy is that any competent psychiatric physician or general medical physician would have medicated the patient, and likely the patient’s eye would still be in her head had that happened,” Golding said in his report.","Naturally, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation not only denied any and all allegations of incompetence, but they issued a counter statement slamming Golding’s report.","“The department strongly disagrees with this individual’s allegations, and looks forward to a fair and thorough review and hearing of all the facts,” a spokeswoman for the CDCR said.","“We have worked closely with lawyers representing prisoners, as well as the court appointment monitors, for many years to improve the mental health of inmates, and our dedicated and well-trained staff will continue to provide appropriate care and treatment,” the spokeswoman continued.","Sadly, this case is just a symptom of a much larger problem stemming from police force being used to handle problems with mental illness. All too often, people in need of dire mental health help get the police instead. Many times, instead of receiving help, they are arrested, beaten, shot, or killed.","Those who are arrested then have their mental health criminalized and are thrown in cages. Sadly, even though this problem has been an issue for years, it is getting worse, not better.","As the LA Times explains, mental healthcare inside prisons isn’t a waning issue for the state. A study published by Stanford Law School in 2017 notes that even as the overall state prison population declines, the prevalence and severity of mental illness among those in the state prison system is on the rise. More than 30% of California prisoners currently receive treatment for serious mental disorders, an increase of 150% since 2000, according to the study.","As TFTP previously reported, the Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy Center, an organization dedicated to eliminating the barriers faced by those with severe mental illnesses, released a jaw-dropping report. In their report titled, Overlooked in the Undercounted: The Role of Mental Illness in Fatal Law Enforcement Encounters, researchers discovered that people with an untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during an interaction with police than anyone else.","According to the study, by all accounts – official and unofficial – a minimum of 1 in 4 fatal police encounters ends the life of an individual with severe mental illness.","

She got out of the shower, and when she answered the door, Gray found Euclid police officer James Aoki standing there, yelling at her.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","“He started shouting he was tired of me, got complaints about me and to turn down my music,” Gray said. “Which I did because at this point I’m flabbergasted. I’m shocked, like, what is this about?”",Gray says she tried to comply with the officer but then he just “barged” into her apartment with no warrant and began attacking her.,"“As he’s slamming me and pushing me against the freezer and refrigerator, he’s twisting my arms up in an uncomfortable position,” she said. “I’m telling him then, ‘You’re hurting me. Why are you doing this to me? Please stop.’ ”","As News Channel 5 reports, in the lawsuit, Gray alleged she was only wearing a bath wrap at the time of the incident, and it fell off while Aoki assaulted her, exposing her chest. She claimed he would not allow her to get dressed before he took her to the police department.","Because Akoi wasn’t wearing a body camera, we don’t know exactly what happened inside the apartment. However, when another officer arrived, they were wearing one. That video showed Akoi dragging a distressed Gray down the stairs, wearing only a towel, begging the officer to allow her to put on clothes.","“So at this point, I’m screaming and yelling with all the mixed emotions going on, crying, just in disbelief that this was happening,” Gray said. “[I was] humiliated, embarrassed, disrespected, everything. Just ashamed.”","As Akoi continues to drag the woman to the car, she continues to beg. But her pleas were ignored.","“This is the point where I’m asking him and telling him, ‘Please let me get dressed.’ And I’m still saying, ‘You’re hurting me.’ Nothing. This man had nothing in his eyes,” she said. “It was just the worst day of my life.”","Gray filed a complaint with the notoriously violent department who then promptly ‘investigated’ and then cleared themselves, blaming Gray for her treatment.","“You continued to resist and the officer used the force necessary to take you into custody,” the findings said, in part. “It was unfortunate that your turbulent behavior caused you to have a wardrobe malfunction, although, according to video footage and in opposition to your statement, your top was up and your breasts were not exposed when you were escorted outside of the apartment complex in handcuffs.”","Despite the officer’s report, however, police did not have enough evidence to convict Gray and she was acquitted of the charges filed against which included resisting arrest, obstruction of official business and noise violation charges.",As News Channel 5 reports:,"Her lawsuit, which alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution and excessive force, said Gray suffered and continues to suffer physical, emotional and psychological injuries, as well as economic losses.","The injuries suffered by Gray were “preventable” had Aoki “not engaged in unconstitutional conduct in violation of her fundamental rights,” the complaint said.","In addition, the lawsuit alleges the City of Euclid failed to “effectively” investigate the incident or discipline Aoki for “illegal behavior” and “false testimony.”",WEWS reviewed city records and found Aoki has been involved in 15 other incidents involving the use of force since 2016 — the eighth highest number of any officer within the police department.,Gray’s lawsuit was the sixth filed against the city for excessive force in the last two years.,"Now, the taxpayers will be held accountable for the disturbing actions of this public servant.",,"

An officer—who was hired in spite of his criminal record—was seen on body camera video punching a handcuffed teen who was not resisting at all. ,"Louisville, KY — Body camera video from inside the Louisville Metro corrections center shows that officers can and will beat an entirely compliant, submissive person, even when that person is handcuffed. It also illustrates that they can do this and face no charges.","According to a recent lawsuit, filed by the victim, Terry Whitehead, then a 19-year-old inmate, the incident happened on April 15. Whitehead was attempting to explain to officers why he had put up toilet paper in his cell to block his window.","“Whitehead, what are you doing, man?” says an unidentified officer wearing the body camera. “I ain’t never had a problem out of you. Why you gotta spit on us? Sergeants come around. You know how this is.”",Whitehead responds to the officer by telling him that he was just using the toilet and wanted some privacy.,"In response to Whitehead telling officer David Schwartz that he was using the toilet, the officer reared back his fist as if he were going to strike Whitehead.","“I do not give you problems like that, Schwartz bro,” he tells the officer as he flinches in fear.","But the fact that the 19-year-old had given him no reason to get violent was of no consequence to officer Schwartz, and just like that, he punched the handcuffed teen in the face.","Schwartz then walks out of the jail, slamming the door into the wall twice before moving further down the hall.",As the Courier-Journal reports:,"The incident led to the firing of Schwartz, 47, who at the time was a probationary officer. In his termination letter, corrections Director Mark Bolton wrote the former Marine didn’t have the temperament for the job, and noted there was property damage from his “fit of rage.”","A second probationary officer, Devan Edwards, 21, was also fired by Bolton. His firing letter noted he failed to report the incident and also cited earlier “unprofessional actions” on social media as reasons for his termination.",Both were hired as recruits in September 2017.,"Whitehead has filed suit against the two fired officers in U.S. District Court in Louisville claiming excessive force, assault and battery.","He was pepper sprayed, handcuffed and badly beaten, according to the suit, which seeks monetary damages for medical bills and pain and suffering, punitive damages, and a jury trial.",The suit claims Edwards had allowed Whitehead to put the tissue paper over an opening in his cell door for privacy when using the bathroom.,"Schwartz demanded that Whitehead take down the toilet paper from the window, but Whitehead said he couldn’t at the time as he was still using the bathroom, according to the lawsuit.",Whitehead apparently got into a verbal dispute with the officers over the toilet paper incident which was escalated to the officers deploying pepper spray and placing Whitehead in handcuffs.,"According to the lawsuit, the officers handcuffed Whitehead, hit him, then moved him to a different area and continued to beat the handcuffed man out of the view of the camera.",The lawsuit states that Whitehead blacked out during the beating and was left with multiple contusions and swelling as a result. It took officers more than a week to finally bring Whitehead to the hospital after he lost consciousness in custody.,"After Bolton watched the video, he fired both officers for use of force violations, referring to the incident as “disturbing.”","“What I saw on that video is disturbing and is not reflective of what we expect from our staff,” Bolton said at the time.","Steve Durham, assistant director of Metro Corrections, said in an interview that Edwards was fired because he failed to report the use of force and didn’t seek medical attention for the inmate, according to the Courier-Journal.","Now, because the department was unable to keep their officers in check, the taxpayers will be shelling out thousands to pay for their acts.","“If don’t nobody believe he deserves justice, I do,” Janelle Stark, Whitehead’s mother said. “And I’m going to make sure he gets it.”","“I’m hurt, my heart is broken,” Stark said.",Below is the footage. Notice how Whitehead is in such fear of further pain that he tries to plead with the officers to stop. Disturbing indeed.,,"

"A Georgia couple, trying to get their child back, was insulted by a cop who euphemistically demanded that the give him oral sex.","Griffin, GA — A rather compelling reason for a requirement of police police officers to wear body cameras was released last week—from a body camera—of a Georgia officer telling a couple to “suck my d***.”","The video was not originally released because the department attempted to keep it secret when 11Alive News requested “any and all” video pertaining to the incident. Instead of giving the news company the video which clearly showed the officer degrading the citizens, they were given video of a body camera pointing toward the ceiling.",As 11Alive reports:,A second police body camera video — showing the entire exchange — was released to the 11Alive Investigators only after we found evidence of its existence in an internal police department email.,Officer Travis Wick resigned from the Griffin Police Department after begging Police Chief Mike Yates not to fire him.,"Officer Wick was one of two officers responding to a call for help from Andrew Orahoske, who is locked in a custody fight for his daughter. The Griffin officers told Orahoske that they could not take the girl from her mother without a signed order by a judge.","According to the report, officers were attempting to find out who Orahoske was and he refused to give his name.","“I’m not gonna give you none of my information now, because I don’t want to get in trouble tonight,” he said.",When the man refused to give his name—which was entirely legal—that’s when the officer demanded oral sex.,"“Well, you can suck my d***!” said officer Wick.","After the officer made the comment, the situation escalated.","“We asked you for help with getting our child back and you asked us to suck your d***,” the woman said.","“No I didn’t,” replied officer Wick.","“Yes you did,” replied the woman.","“No, I didn’t ask you. I asked him to (perform oral sex),” the officer replied.","As the video shows, Wick then called his supervisor on his cell phone and said, “and he’s like, ‘well just never mind, I’m not going to give you my information.’ And I told him, ‘well you can suck my d***!’ And they flipped out.”","“I f***ed up,” the officer told his lieutenant.",Wick then lit up a cigarette in his patrol car and drove off.,"In the report, the officer made no mention of the comment and instead blamed the couple for being irate.","The citizens “seemed to become irritated that the police couldn’t help them, and became uncooperative at which point they requested a supervisor to the scene,” according to the police report.",The transcript of Wick’s disciplinary process was obtained by 11Alive.,"“You made a pretty darn stupid remark,” Chief Yates told Officer Wick during an August 29 disciplinary meeting. Officer Wick replied, “I just said it. I don’t know why. I don’t. I mean that’s it, chief. It was f****** stupid, man.”","The police chief agreed, but worried how this incident would look to outsiders, according to 11Alive. Chief Yates asked Officer Wick, “if you got involved in a…use of deadly force, and then somebody got that video and played it, how do you think that would play out? If were sitting in federal court or before some grand jury or something like that?”",Wick then begged the chief not to fire him but the chief then brought up the fact that Wick had just been fired from his previous job as a cop at the Locust Grove Police Department.,"“If that was just a one-time thing,” the chief said, “and it just popped out of nowhere because you were having a bad day and your dog just died, that would be one thing. But on the tail end of you being hired after you got fired from Locust Grove…”","According to department records, Wick was fired because he called in sick and then showed up to court with a .036 blood alcohol content, just before he was scheduled to testify. He was testifying that a fellow officer offered to buy him a steak dinner in exchange for dropping DUI charges. Seriously.","Luckily, this officer was fired for his conduct. However, that does not prevent him from continuing to be a gypsy cop and moving to the next department down the road.",,"

Thomas Ogle's Vapor Fuel System allowed test vehicles to achieve over 100 miles per gallon of gasoline in 1977—with no carbon emissions.,"While some people believe the story of American inventor Thomas Ogle is a myth or urban legend, the reality is that Ogle designed and implemented a “vapor carburetor” that allowed a vehicle to achieve over 100 miles per gallon of gasoline in 1977—with no carbon emissions.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","Sadly, Ogle’s invention would never see the light of day.","After surviving an assassination attempt, Ogle subsequently died under suspicious circumstances only months later.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));",“Are you afraid of oil companies or the Arabs coming after you?” journalist Ron Laytner presciently asked Ogle in 1978—three year prior to his death.,"“No. Not any more. I’ve had too much publicity. If I’d kept my invention a secret I might be worrying. But there’s nothing to worry about any more,” said Ogle.","The saga began on April 30, 1977, as Ogle unveiled his invention to the world in a consumption test using a 1970 Ford Galaxie, which unmodified achieved roughly 13 miles per gallon. The test saw the inventor drive a journalist 205 miles on just two gallons of gasoline—achieving over 100 miles per gallon.",The results of his road tests were so spectacular that the car was inspected for hidden fuel tanks. None were found and those who drove with Ogle confirmed that they had never stopped to refuel.,"Subsequently, the amazing technology was publicized in the El Paso Times, Argosy Magazine, The Philadelphia Enquirer, and many other publications—bringing Ogle’s invention nationwide attention.",,"The modified car was extensively tested and engineers found no evidence of fraud, although naysayers point out that there was no scientifically valid testing of the device to independently corroborate the invention’s purported capabilities.","Ogle’s Vapor Fuel System—US Patent # 4,177,779—Fuel Economy System for an Internal Combustion Engine was set to revolutionize the auto industry.","Abstract: A fuel economy system for an internal combustion engine which, when installed in a motor vehicle, obviates the need for a conventional carburetor, fuel pump and gasoline tank. The system operates by using the engine vacuum to draw fuel vapors from a vapor tank through a vapor conduit to a vapor equalizer which is positioned directly over the intake manifold of the engine. The vapor tank is constructed of heavy duty steel or the like to withstand the large vacuum pressure and includes an air inlet valve coupled for control to the accelerator pedal. The vapor equalizer ensures distribution of the correct mixture of air and vapor to the cylinders of the engine for combustion, and also includes its own air inlet valve coupled for control to the accelerator pedal. The system utilizes vapor-retarding filters in the vapor conduit, vapor tank and vapor equalizer to deliver the correct vapor/air mixture for proper operation. The vapor tank and fuel contained therein are heated by running the engine coolant through a conduit within the tank. Due to the extremely lean fuel mixtures used by the present invention, gas mileage in excess of one hundred miles per gallon may be achieved.","One expert proponent of Ogle’s invention was Professor Gerald Hawkins of Texas A&M University, a mechanical engineer with a background in gas dynamics and aerospace study.","“This is no hoax,” said Dr. Hawkins, “Ogle eliminated the carburetor and achieved what the gasoline internal combustion engine was supposed to do all along – to operate off fumes.”","Ogle’s invention, dubbed the “Oglemobile,” was set to revolutionize the auto industry.","The inventor was courted by international financiers, oil companies, and vehicle manufacturers – with almost everyone foreseeing a future filled with fame and riches.","Ogle was contacted by C.F. Ramsey an “international financier” who wanted to buy the device’s patent and the marketing rights, according to journalist Ron Laytner.","Ramsey eventually signed a contract with Ogle that allowed the inventor to work on his device with financial backing from Ramsey – who, per the agreement, would take over the patent, distribution and development rights of the Oglemobile.","Ramsey told Laytner by phone,","“We signed a preliminary agreement with Tom Ogle the very next day after we saw the invention. All kinds of people were in town, J.C. Penny, Transamerica, General Motors, Ford and others. Specifically Shell Oil offered Tom $25 million. Everybody was after him.”","In June 1978, a few months after Laytner’s first interview with Ogle, his new financial backer, C.F. Ramsey, sold out to Advance Fuel Systems Inc. in what was later determined to be a pre-planned handoff, unbeknownst to Ogle.",According to Laytner:,"Tom was a bit nervous in my later phone calls, but all seemed to be well. He would continue receiving $5,000 a month and funds for research and development. He’d also get 6 percent royalties when the device came to market. Advance Fuel’s own engineers would develop the ‘Oglemobile’ for marketing and in April 1979, a still very ambitious Tom Ogle opened the first of a planned 1,000 nation-wide diagnostic car centers.",But Ogle’s first and only car center soon closed and his monthly checks stopped. Ogle was told he’d get no royalties because AFS was working on a device that got similar results but wasn’t his invention.,"On April 14, 1981, Ogle was shot by an unknown assailant in what many deem an assassination attempt—the shooter was never apprehended.","Subsequently, on August 18, Ogle went to a friend’s home, after drinking at The Smugglers Inn, and collapsed. He was taken to El Paso’s Eastwood Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His death was eventually ruled accidental or suicide, which allegedly involved a combination of prescription pain pills and alcohol.","Many suspect that Ogle’s death was simply a cover-up of his murderer—as he had previously told his lawyer, Bobby Perel, that he thought his drinks were being drugged, especially in The Smugglers Inn where he was playing billiards.","There is no question that Ogle was harassed by power-hungry oil companies, with billions of dollars on the line, that worked diligently to terminate his research and stifle the progress of his highly-efficient technology.","Ogle’s death in 1981 was very likely related to certain powerful energy interests’ awareness of the power of his invention—subsequently, the technology has never seen the light of day.","(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.0';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));",This Modified Engine Allows Any Car to Drive Over 100 MPG,This modified engine was demonstrated to drive over 100 miles on a single gallon of gas.

The chemical in Round-Up that has been known to cause cancer has been found in 31 out of 45 food products including multiple children's cereals.,"According to a new study conducted by the non-profit Environmental Working Group (EWG), a large number of consumer products, including children’s cereal, contain the carcinogen Glyphosate.","Glyphosate is, of course, the chemical that was recently found to cause cancer and other health problems. Glyphosate is the main ingredient in Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup, which has been slowly getting banned all over the world this year.",The study reported that 31 out of 45 of the products that were tested contained levels of the chemical that are potentially unsafe. These products ranged from snack foods and granola bars to children’s cereal.,"“We’re very concerned that consumers are eating more glyphosate than they know,” Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs at EWG told CBS News.","Some of the companies named in the study have responded to the accusations, claiming that their products may contain Glyphosate, but not enough to actually cause any harm.","General Mills, the company behind many of the cereals tested in the study, issued the following statement in response:","Our products are safe and without question they meet regulatory safety levels. The EPA has researched this issue and has set rules that we follow as do farmers who grow crops including wheat and oats. We continue to work closely with farmers, our suppliers and conservation organizations to minimize the use of pesticides on the crops and ingredients we use in our foods.","Quaker, who was also named in the study, had this to say:","We proudly stand by the safety and quality of our Quaker products. Producing healthy, wholesome food is Quaker’s number one priority, and we’ve been doing that for more than 140 years.","Quaker does not add glyphosate during any part of the milling process. Glyphosate is commonly used by farmers across the industry who apply it pre-harvest. Once the oats are transported to us, we put them through our rigorous process that thoroughly cleanses them (de-hulled, cleaned, roasted and flaked).",Any levels of glyphosate that may remain are significantly below any regulatory limits and well within compliance of the safety standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as safe for human consumption.,"Quaker continually evaluates our product portfolio to ensure the highest quality and safety standards for our consumers. While our products comply with all safety and regulatory requirements, we are happy to be part of the discussion and are interested in collaborating with industry peers, regulators and other interested parties on glyphosate.","Monsanto even issued a statement of their own, telling CBS that “glyphosate does not cause cancer” and “has a more than 40-year history of safe use.”","The statement went on to say that, “even at the highest level reported… an adult would have to eat 118 pounds of the food item every day for the rest of their life in order to reach the EPA’s limit” for glyphosate residues.","It may be very true that the researchers who conducted the study were using a lower threshold than the EPA does to determine the toxicity, but scientists disagree about what the safe level actually is, with many thinking that the official standard is dangerously high.","Furthermore, the EPA has been caught tampering with these threshold levels in pesticides before.","In 2013, as a fresh wave of studies showing the dangers of the chemical were being released, the EPA actually raised the accepted levels.","A 2015 report from the Chicago Tribune revealed that the EPA intentionally obfuscated data and changed their own standards so they could allow an unsafe chemical made by DOW to get an acceptable rating. After the EPA approved the chemical, a number of environmental groups including the Center for Food Safety and Earthjustice quickly sued the agency, forcing them to retract their approval several months later.","When the EPA finally reversed their decision in 2015, they claimed that “new information” surfaced to make them change their minds, however, according to the Tribune’s report and the accusations of many activists, the EPA knew all along and were colluding with DOW to approve a substance that was proven to be harmful.","The chemical in question was a new herbicide that combined 2,4-D and glyphosate.","According to the Tribune’s report,","EPA now says it is safe to allow 41 times more 2,4-D into the American diet [than previously allowed for decades]. To reach that conclusion . . . the agency’s scientists changed their analysis of a pivotal rat study by Dow, tossing aside signs of kidney trouble that Dow researchers said were caused by 2,4-D.","The report went on to describe how the EPA received test results from DOW that proved their product was below the EPA’s standards, so they tampered with the study so it would pass.","As The Free Thought Project reported last week, a landmark case against Monsanto’s Roundup weedkiller concluded in San Francisco in which a jury awarded $289 million in damages to a former school groundskeeper, Dewayne Johnson, concluding that Roundup gave him terminal cancer.","

A shocking cell phone video taken from inside a hospital shows a Detroit cop repeatedly punching a naked woman in the face and head.,"Detroit, MI — An utterly shocking video was released this week—taken from inside a hospital—of a Detroit police officer savagely beating a naked mentally ill woman.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));",The video was sent to local news station FOX 2 by a witness to the horrifying beating. What it shows is nothing short of barbarous abuse of a defenseless woman by a public servant.,"Although Detroit police have refused to identify the officer, they did say that he has been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","As the extremely graphic video shows, the woman was naked and swearing as several officers attempted to restrain her. When she yanks away from the cop, he begins pummeling her, repeatedly.","As FOX reports, the woman, believed to be a patient at the hospital, was punched several times. The woman who recorded the video told FOX 2 she was visiting a relative at the hospital. She said it was clear the woman was mentally unstable, though that has not been confirmed by the hospital.","The woman who took the video also pointed out that there were enough officers to get the victim under control but this officer took to beating her anyway. The witness also pointed out that out of all of these officers, not a single one tried to stop the cop from repeatedly slamming his fists into the naked woman’s face.","“So many of them, they could have restrained her or tried to stop him. He was physically giving her blows to the face, to the body. The lady was screaming stop hitting her like that, don’t punch her like that,” the woman said.","Detroit Police Public Information Officer Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood told FOX 2 they are conducting an internal investigation to “determine if the force used was reasonable and necessary.” Kirkwood did not comment further on the video Wednesday night, according to FOX 2.","“The situation was escalated to the appropriate DMC authority. DRH security was notified who immediately filed an internal report and also called DPD. DPD responded to the hospital where DMC filed a report with them,” Kirkwood noted.","On Friday, in response to the video, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said what he witnessed was “very disturbing” and noted that the investigation into the officer is a criminal one.","During a press conference, Craig explained that the woman was picked up by police in response to a “lewd and lascivious in progress” call around 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday. Officers said the woman was found walking around a neighborhood naked.","Craig explained that the woman was non-violent, not agitated, and entirely passive. Apparently the woman was so calm that officers didn’t even feel the need to handcuff her. The lack of handcuffs was an apparent concern to Craig.","“We know from our training and experience anytime we transport someone, particularly if they are suffering from mental illness for their safety and for the officers’ safety and the community’s safety that we handcuff,” he said.",The responding officers gave the woman a robe and then transported her to the Detroit Receiving Hospital for evaluation.,"According to Craig, when the woman — who remains unnamed — got to the hospital, she took off the robe, became agitated, and began fighting with staff. At this point, according to Craig, that’s when the officer began punching her.","Chief Craig noted that the officer’s punches were in accordance to the use of force at first. However, when the naked woman turned her back to the officer and he kept pummeling her, this was an issue.","“At that point we have grave concerns for the officer’s actions,” he said.","Officers should not continue to use “hard hands” on someone who turns their back, Craig said. We tend to agree.","Below is the shocking footage. If you’d like to peacefully let the Detroit police department know how you feel about this officer savagely beating a naked woman, you can do so at the Facebook page, here. ",,"

"The New York Police Department suspended the use of some 3,000 body cameras after one of them began smoking and exploded. ","New York, NY — (RT) The New York Police Department has suspended the use of almost 3,000 body cameras after one exploded, leaving some of the city’s police force unrecorded for the foreseeable future. According to studies, not much will change.","An NYPD officer noticed smoke rising from his camera on Saturday, and took it off before it exploded. Nobody was injured in the incident, but the department instructed all officers equipped with Vievu LE-5 body cameras to return them to their precincts.","“Nothing is more important than the safety of our officers, and equipping the NYPD with the best equipment is a paramount priority,” read a statement from the NYPD. The department believes that a battery malfunction caused the device to explode.","There are 2,990 NYPD officers with LE-5 cameras, and another 12,500 with an older model. Officers with the older model will continue to wear their cameras.","The NYPD began outfitting its officers with body cameras in 2017, and before this weekend’s mishap, all patrol officers were on track to be equipped with the devices by the end of this year. Proponents hope that having an objective record of officers’ interactions with suspects and the general public can force the officers to remain on their best behavior at all times.","The idea took off following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, and by 2015, 95 percent of large police departments nationwide had began or planned to begin using the cameras in some way.","However, one study conducted in Washington DC and released last year found that officers wearing cameras still received almost the same amount of civilian complaints as officers who didn’t.","“Law enforcement agencies (particularly in contexts similar to Washington, DC) that are considering adopting BWCs [cameras] should not expect dramatic reductions in use of force or complaints, or other large-scale shifts in police behavior, solely from the deployment of this technology,” the study concluded.","In New York, misconduct complaints against NYPD officers actually increased after body cameras were rolled out last year. The Civilian Complaint Review Board reported 4,487 complaints in 2017, up 202 from 2016. Before the uptick, complaints had been declining since 2009.","Complaints were evenly split between black and white officers, and over half of all the complainants alleged an “abuse of authority.” Police union boss Patrick Lynch called the increase “meaningless,” stated that 90 percent of them resulted in no finding of misconduct, and accused the CCRB of “anti-cop bias.”","Body camera footage has been crucial in implicating or exonerating officers in certain cases, however. In the police shooting of a mentally ill man in the Bronx last September, activists argued that body camera footage showed that officers failed to do enough to de-escalate their confrontation with the man, who they mowed down with gunfire after he waved a replica gun at them.","On the other hand, body camera footage helped clear Bronx Sergeant Hugh Barry, who was charged with murder after he shot a schizophrenic woman in her apartment in October 2016. Barry claimed the woman charged him with a baseball bat, a claim that his body camera backed up. Barry was acquitted this February.","After this weekend’s malfunction, almost 3,000 officers will now hit the streets unrecorded. However, according to complaint records and national studies, little will change.","

Mortality rates have skyrocketed for groups such as infants, pregnant mothers, and the elderly as clinics have shut down and medicine grown scarce. Food has disappeared from store shelves forcing the population to consume pets and zoo animals. A recent poll found that 78% of Venezuelans “reported trouble keeping themselves fed.”","Of course, this is not true for all Venezuelans.","Earlier this week President Nicolas Maduro was seen in a plush Istanbul restaurant lavishly dining on expensive steaks while smoking fine cigars, the check paid for by the wealth his regime has drained from his people. Once again we see that under socialism “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”","While the outrage over Maduro’s obtuse opulence is well deserved, it serves as only a gaudy reminder of how socialism actually operates in the real world. The more controlled an economy becomes, the more it benefits those with power.","While less obvious than Maduro’s dinner prepared by celebrity chefs, we’ve seen this play out throughout the country. The regime understands that its survival depends upon keeping the guns of government pointed at the people, and not at themselves. As such, the country has fallen into rule by corruption, with the police and military being offered access to food and supplies in exchange for their loyalty.","Maduro’s government is able to benefit from the trade in a variety of ways. As a South American businessman told an AP reporter last year, a bribe to the right official allows him to sell his goods to the Venezuelan government. He can afford to pay it because the government pays him a higher price than international markets do. The government then takes the food and gives it to the military, who is then able to feed their families and sell the rest — and for dollars as opposed to increasingly worthless bolivars.","It’s been noted that in Venezuela today, black markets in food are “a better business than drugs.” As is the case with any other black market, the business is even better if it comes with the protection of a government badge. Not only is Maduro’s regime active in supplying the black markets of government officers, but they also unleash the police on the bachaqueros — illegal vendors — that compete with them.",This is not the only way that those with state privilege are able to profit from the horrors of socialism.,"As the Miami Herald reported recently, those close to Maduro — including his stepsons — have been able to exploit the government’s currency exchanges at rates that don’t take into consideration the hyperinflation going on within the country. It has resulted in $1.2 billion money-laundering case filed in Miami:","In the Miami federal case, prosecutors charge that a network of Venezuelan businessmen and executives with the national oil company PDVSA managed to quickly turn $42 million worth of bolivars into $600 million in U.S. dollars by simply making a “loan” to the state-owned firm. PDVSA tapped into the government exchange to pay off the loan in a few months and, according to federal court records, funneled the windfall back to the ring. Its members then hid the money in Europe and the U.S. and bought up mansions from Cocoplum to Wellington in South Florida.","Russell Dallen, a Miami businessman who manages a capital investment company and formerly owned a newspaper in Venezuela, dubbed the government currency scheme a “perpetual money machine.”","“That’s one of the reasons why Venezuela has not changed this [government exchange] system,” said Dallen, a financial investor who has closely followed the money-laundering case.","This corruption, of course, is not unique to Maduro’s regime — but simply a byproduct of the socialist system he inherited. Hugo Chavez may still remain popular among many within the country, but his own corruption has enabled his daughter to enjoy a life of luxury. Her wealth has been estimated in the billions, so she can even afford more houses than Bernie Sanders and nicer outfits than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.","Socialism is sold to the idealistic and naïve as a way to end the inequality that exists in a free market. In reality, it only changes the way in which power and privilege is consolidated. On the market, wealth is acquired through voluntary exchange and serving the desires of consumers — one of the many ways it makes us more humane. In socialism it’s acquired through force and brutality. As F.A. Hayek explained in The Road to Serfdom, the result is the worst rising to the top.","For the people in Venezuela, their future will not be improved by simply replacing Maduro for a more modest socialist leader. It can only come by rejecting the very ideology that has eroded away the country’s wealth for decades. Until then, those with political power will continue to live at the expense of their neighbors.","Tho is an assistant editor for the Mises Wire, and can assist with questions from the press.","

"A team of lawyers has successfully petitioned the federal government, by presenting them with evidence indicating that explosives were used to bring down the World Trade Centers.","In what can be described as a monumental step forward in the relentless pursuit of 9/11 truth, a United States Attorney has agreed to comply with federal law requiring submission to a Special Grand Jury of evidence that explosives were used to bring down the World Trade Centers.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","The Lawyers’ Committee for 9/11 Inquiry successfully submitted a petition to the federal government demanding that the U.S. Attorney present to a Special Grand Jury extensive evidence of yet-to-be-prosecuted federal crimes relating to the destruction of three World Trade Center Towers on 9/11 (WTC1, WTC2 and WTC7).","After waiting months for the reply, the U.S. Attorney responded in a letter, noting that they will comply with the law.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));","“We have received and reviewed The Lawyers’ Committee for 9/11 Inquiry, Inc.’s submissions of April 10 and July 30, 2018. We will comply with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3332 as they relate to your submissions,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman stated.","This letter from the U.S. Attorney was signed by Michael Ferrara and Ilan Graff, Chiefs, Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.","As the Lawyers’ Committee for 9/11 Committee points out, the U.S. Attorney’s letter does not spell out the steps that will be taken to comply, but 18 U.S.C. § 3332 is clear as to what these steps must be. This law states: “[a]ny such [United States] attorney receiving information concerning such an alleged offense from any other person shall, if requested by such other person, inform the [Special] grand jury of such alleged offense, the identity of such other person, and such attorney’s action or recommendation.” This law also states that “(a) It shall be the duty of each such [special] grand jury impaneled within any judicial district to inquire into offenses against the criminal laws of the United States alleged to have been committed within that district.”","To illustrate just how historic this response is, below is a summary of the information presented to the federal government via the petition. It does not mince words and details the overwhelming evidence indicating the use of explosives in bringing down the twin towers as well as tower 7.","The Lawyers’ Committee’s April 10th 52-page original Petition was accompanied by 57 exhibits and presented extensive evidence that explosives were used to destroy three WTC buildings. That evidence included independent scientific laboratory analysis of WTC dust samples showing the presence of high-tech explosives and/or incendiaries; numerous first-hand reports by First Responders of explosions at the WTC on 9/11; expert analysis of seismic evidence that explosions occurred at the WTC towers on 9/11 prior to the airplane impacts and prior to the building collapses; and expert analysis by architects, engineers, and scientists concluding that the rapid onset symmetrical near-free-fall acceleration collapse of three WTC high rise buildings on 9/11 exhibited the key characteristics of controlled demolition. The Lawyers’ Committee’s July 30th Amended Petition addresses several additional federal crimes beyond the federal bombing crime addressed in the original Petition. The Lawyers’ Committee concluded in the petitions that explosive and incendiary devices preplaced at the WTC were detonated causing the complete collapse of the WTC Twin Towers on 9/11 and increasing the tragic loss of life.","Attorney Mick Harrison, Litigation Director, stated: “The failure of our government to diligently investigate this disturbing evidence has contributed to the erosion of trust in our institutions. The Lawyers’ Committee felt it was our duty as public citizens to submit this evidence to the U.S. Attorney for submission to the Special Grand Jury.”","Finally, after nearly two decades of ridicule, dismissal, and outright intolerance of information contrary to the “official story” of what happened on 9/11, the public may finally learn the truth.","

"Yellow Springs, OH — Comedian Dave Chappelle was moved to attend a city council meeting in the small Ohio town where he lives, following a New Year’s Eve incident in which officers acted aggressively toward revelers — to call out what many felt was the small town’s dangerous flirtation with brutal policing.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1']));","Duly noting Yellow Springs Police have, indeed, assisted him on two occasions, Chappelle turned to the law enforcement panel and scolded sternly,","“Huge gaffe, New Year’s Eve.”eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'thefreethoughtproject_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));",Affirmative murmurs from the residents in attendance made clear the comedian and political activist wasn’t alone in criticizing police for deploying Tasers against possibly-inebriated African American holidaymakers.,"With a predominantly caucasian population of around 3,500 — and students attending private Antioch College — Yellow Springs is more sleepy, quirky enclave than bustling city, thus has not experienced the worst of a shamefully rampant police violence issue.","Per New Year’s Eve tradition, a crowd gathered downtown to celebrate and watch a disco ball drop at midnight — but the atmosphere turned strangely sour as the event drew to a close. The Chicago Tribune reports,","“Residents told the New York Times that officers began clearing the crowd more swiftly than usual. As they moved to disperse the residents, police said, according to the Times, that a 29-year-old black man named David Carlson, who was drunk, began to threaten officers and hit a squad car. An attorney for Carlson denied he was aggressive. After one officer forced Carlson to the ground, he slipped away into the mostly white crowd, which tried to prevent officers from following him.”","In other words, the crowd moved to prevent unnecessary violence or arrest by police against a man who might have been drinking too heavily at a holiday event. But that didn’t stop the cops.","“There was a Taser deployed in a crowd and it missed,” an anonymous eyewitness told the Yellow Springs News at the time. “It could have hit a child.”","So rare are incidents where police in Yellow Springs have had to employ force of this nature, many residents were stunned the violence, albeit on a constricted scale, had finally touched their town.","Witness and 20-year resident, Anita Brown, told Yellow Springs News, as quoted by the Tribune, the officers seemed “emotionless, with no sense of caring. I witnessed villagers de-escalating and officers escalating, it was so strange, it seemed so backwards.”","“In all fairness,” Chappelle said to audience laughter, discussing the holiday scofflaw, “the crowd was drunk.” He added, deadpan, “because it was New Year’s Eve. … And, I left early, because nobody felt completely ‘right.’”","In response to ensuing contention, if perhaps in deference to outrage against police departments nationwide — those whose errant officers and corrupt supervisors frequently fail to be disciplined for controversial wrongdoings — Yellow Springs Police Chief Dave Hale resigned from the force on January 3.","On Monday, Chappelle attended the village council meeting to advocate for immediate reform of policing, with an eye to community relations, saying the council has “a tremendous opportunity for us to be a leader in progressive law enforcement.”","Where the bond between the community and police shattered was the shift from officers who live in the areas they serve. Noting when he attended school, everyone knew various officers because their children or other family members attended the same schools, Chappelle observed,",“Now we are being policed by what feels like an alien force.”,"Thanks to the government’s military surplus giveaway to local and state law enforcement, an aggressive and combatant — and staunchly authoritarian — method of policing has supplanted the albeit Rockwellian image of Officer Friendly patrolling with a smile, ostensively just decades ago.","Chappelle’s comparison might be new for tiny Yellow Springs, Ohio, but images of stormtrooper cops in military and riot gear, sometimes sporting imposing face shields, automatic rifles, and usually backed by armored vehicles — sometimes menacing, always intimidating — have splashed periodically across headlines for years.","As civilians fight tooth and nail to reform police forces nationwide, the violence wrought by those with a badge and gun continues to infect even the smallest havens like Chappelle’s hometown.","For the down-to-earth, politically-aware comedian, stepping to the mic to be a resounding voice of caution and to advocate for preemptive change is a way to draw attention to a timely cause.","“This is an opportunity to show everybody that local politics reigns supreme,” Chappelle concluded. “We can make our corner of the world outstanding.”",,"

Parents allowing multiple kids to participate in playdates are in violation of Washington D.C. law and bureaucrats may soon require them to get a license to play.,"Washington D.C. (FEE) — Let’s say you and some of your friends decide to gather your young children together a couple of days a week for a few hours of free play. Maybe you switch off who leads the gaggle of kids each week, allowing for some shared free time and flexibility. Sounds like a great arrangement for all, right? Your kids get to play freely with their friends, and you get some occasional free babysitting.","According to government officials in Washington, DC, arrangements like this are violations of the law. They are cracking down on what they call an illegal “child development facility” operating without a license.","Back in the 1970s, a group of parents got together to create an informal playgroup for toddlers in DC in a spare room of a local church. Over the last 40 years, groups of parents and their two-year-olds have enjoyed these three-hour playgroups, which children can attend up to three days a week. The playgroup is staffed by parents of the kids who attend, and they take turns watching the children. There is no paid staff.","The parents are outraged, arguing that this is an informal, parent-led playgroup that should not be regulated as a child care facility.","According to a recent Washington Post article written by Karin Lips of the Network of Enlightened Women, “Some DC government officials now are trying to regulate the program, which they contend is an illegal child-care facility.” The Office of the State Superintendent of Education investigated the playgroup cooperative in early September and issued a statement saying the group is violating child care facility laws and must get a license to operate.","The parents are rightfully outraged, arguing that this is an informal, parent-led playgroup that should not be regulated as a child care facility. Government officials argue that the playgroup doesn’t qualify for an exemption as an “informal” group because the parents, over the years, have established some simple “rules” for participation, including stating that parents can’t bring contagious children to the playgroup and asking for emergency contact information.","As a homeschooling mom, I host groups of children at my house all the time, sometimes with their parents and sometimes without, and my friends reciprocate. I have the same “rules” as this DC playgroup: Don’t bring sick kids to my house, tell me if they have any food allergies or medical issues, give me your phone number in case of emergency, oh, and take off your shoes.","Could the government crack down on these types of playgroups, arguing they are not “informal” because of basic expectations for health and safety? Or are parents so incapable of voluntarily determining health and safety expectations that the government must do it for them?",The state does not need to insert itself into all aspects of private life. Parents are competent enough to create voluntary associations with other parents that benefit their children and themselves. As Lips writes in her article:,"Ironically, if the Office of the State Superintendent of Education has its way and is allowed to regulate this playgroup out of existence, it would be creating a disincentive for parents to self-regulate, as a playgroup with no safety rules would presumably be on stronger legal standing.","If the parents in the DC playgroup were wary of its operations or procedures, they wouldn’t join the cooperative. Parents are highly capable of making judgments regarding their children’s well-being without government meddling.","The DC Council is currently deliberating on what to do with this long-time parent cooperative and similar playgroups. The fact that the Council is involved at all should concern everyone. This is a private, parent-organized group that has operated just fine for over four decades without the Council’s help. The government should leave parents alone and focus on more pressing responsibilities.","Lips warns,","This regulatory encroachment could be the District’s first step toward broader government overreach in this area and the crowding-out of voluntary associations. From nanny-shares to babysitting co-ops to regularly scheduled times to play at public parks, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education investigators could find new opportunities to crack down on the voluntary ways that D.C. families approach playtime and child care for their children.","In DC and elsewhere, government officials should stay clear of telling parents what to do or how to organize. We don’t need a license to let our children play.","

"Scott Shackford|Sep. 27, 2017 1:25 pm",Salt Lake City PoliceThe head of the Salt Lake Police Association has watched the country's outrage over the videos showing a nurse getting arrested for refusing to draw a man's blood without a warrant and has decided the correct response is to complain that the public got to see what its officers did.,"Union head Stephen Hartney sent a letter to the city's mayor and police chief to complain video of the brief arrest of nurse Alex Wubbels has made ""pariahs"" of Det. Jeff Payne and his watch commander at the time of the incident, Lt. James Tracy.","Wubbels became an insta-celebrity on Labor Day weekend after she released police body camera footage showing Payne very forcefully arresting her at University of Utah Hospital because she refused his demand that she draw blood from an unconscious victim of a nasty high-speed car crash. The patient, William Gray, was not a suspect, nor involved in the chase, and Payne didn't have a warrant. Wubbels, surrounded by staff at the hospital, explained that she was not permitted to draw the man's blood. Payne arrested her, in what appeared on video to be sheer frustration at having been defied.",Payne and Tracy have been placed on leave while the case was investigated. A couple of weeks ago the city revealed an internal investigation and a civilian review board determined the two officers violated department policies.,Hartney this week complained the police body camera footage should not have been publicly released until the investigation was completed. From the Salt Lake Tribune:,"The letter said the union was, at this point, not arguing or even discussing the merits of the allegations raised against the officers. ""Rather we are solely concerned... with the 'investigatory process' which we believe has been corrupted.""","The letter claims the city has not followed an ""agreed upon and carefully scripted process"" for investigating the conduct of police officers. At the news conference, Hartney focused on if the city should have released the footage so soon under the state's Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA), considering the release could have interfered with the internal affairs investigation.","The release of the body cam footage and information from the disciplinary investigation ""has created a public furor which makes reasoned determinations difficult, if not impossible,"" the letter states.","The city, however, didn't release the videos. It agreed to a request by Wubbels to release the footage to her, following the law Hartney referenced. The city said it had no good reason to deny the video footage to Wubbels.",The two officers weren't even put on administrative leave until after Wubbels went public with the video footage.,What might have been forgotten in all of this is Wubbels released the video because she believed she was exposing a widespread problem of police bullying nurses into drawing blood without consent or a warrant.,"And while Wubbels was pleased the Salt Lake City Police had been responsive to her claims of abuse, she and other hospital staff were concerned about other law enforcement agencies, including university police. Campus police did absolutely nothing during the arrest, and since then the hospital has implemented new policies to limit police access to parts of the hospital.","Public pressure and response is important to holding police officers accountable. They are public servants, and Hartney's responses, like we've seen from other police union leaders, misuse the concept of due process to try to conceal information from the people to whom the police are supposed to answer.",Yesterday we saw that a North Carolina law exempting body camera footage from public records requests was very clearly being used to try to shield police from exposure of conduct that might expose them to public criticism.,"Gray, the car crash victim unable to consent to Payne's demand for a blood draw, died Monday while still in the hospital.",Photo Credit: Salt Lake City Police,Scott Shackford is an associate editor at Reason.com,Scott Shackford is an associate editor at Reason.com,"

With rifles pointing toward each side and tensions reaching a critical level, federal land officials backed off and agreed to give up the cattle to Bundy's family and supporters.
The mid-afternoon release by the Bureau of Land Management was hailed as a victory among supporters who had forced the closure of Interstate 15 after marching to the holding pen on the sides of the highway, although environmentalists condemned the agency's decision.
The BLM, upset that Bundy has refused to pay about $1 million in grazing fees to the federal government for two decades, had seized at least one-third of his cattle earlier this past week in a raging debate that captured national attention and whose purpose also was to protect a critical habitat of the threatened desert tortoise.
But on Saturday the BLM decided to halt the roundup, fearing for the safety of its agents and the public.
Bundy was overcome with joy when told of the pullout earlier Saturday, and his enthusiasm caught on. A crowd just outside his ranch cheered as he shouted, ""Good morning, America!

"Peter Suderman|Sep. 21, 2017 4:12 pm",Ron Sachs/SIPA/NewscomThe desperate Republican effort to cobble together the votes necessary to pass legislation that would rewrite Obamacare has now descended into low farce.,"For backers of Graham-Cassidy, which supporters have described as a repeal of Obamacare, the number one target is Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, who was one of three Senate Republicans who voted against a previous repeal plan in July. The way they are trying to win her over is by offering legislative kickbacks that are explicitly designed to help Murkowski's home state.","One funding boost was already included in the initial draft of the legislation. A report this afternoon indicates that the chief backers of the bill, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) are looking to add several more carve outs that would specifically target Alaska. If added to the legislation, these carve outs would let Alaska escape the core features of Graham-Cassidy.","In essence, they would be attempting to bribe Murkowski to vote to repeal Obamacare by letting her state keep Obamacare.","The core idea behind the Graham-Cassidy legislation is to convert Obamacare into a system of block grants. Medicaid would be transformed into a per-capita grant, meaning that funding would be capped per individual. Obamacare's premium tax credits for people buying insurance through state health insurance exchanges would be eliminated. Instead, that money would be given to states, which would have more leeway to determine how it is spent.","But according to a report by IJR's Haley Byrd, based on information provided by a GOP Senate aide, Sens. Graham and Cassidy are working on a new draft that would keep Obamacare's premium tax credits in place in Alaska and Hawaii, delay the implementation of the per-capita grants the legislation envisions for Medicaid for both states, and provide both with an additional boost to federal Medicaid funding.","It is possible that these changes will not be inserted into the legislation. But if they were, Alaska would effectively be exempt from the fundamental policy changes that Graham-Cassidy seeks to enact. Adding these provisions to the legislation would constitute an implicit admission that its most prominent reforms are not necessary.","Indeed, the attempted bribe appears to be even more brazen than that. These exemptions would reportedly come in addition to the block grant that Alaska was already scheduled to receive under the proposed legislation.","In other words, Alaska would not merely be allowed to keep Obamacare in its current form. It would also be given a large infusion of new money from the block grant. It would be a bribe on top of a bribe.","This would not be the first attempt to buy Murkowski's vote with bonus funding targeted at Alaska. The initial draft of the legislation included additional Medicaid money for ""low-density states"" that have unusually high per-capita health care spending—which curiously seems to apply only to Alaska and possibly North Dakota.",There is real merit to the idea that states should be allowed more flexibility to regulate their health care systems. But there are serious questions about whether this legislation would provide the sort of flexibility its supporters claim.,"Yet what the effort to woo Murkowski shows is that Republicans who support Graham-Cassidy are not attempting to win votes for the bill by making the case for its substantive merits. Indeed, few even seem to understand the mechanics of how it would work.","Instead, they are attempting to buy off wavering lawmakers with transparent bribery that not only adds to the cost of the law, but undermines the chief argument for its necessity. If this indicates the general quality of the arguments in favor of the bill, then it does not deserve to pass.",Peter Suderman is managing editor of reason.com.,Peter Suderman is managing editor of reason.com.,"

Menu,"EUCLID, Ohio — The woman who 
filed a federal lawsuit

    

 against a Euclid Police officer Thursday said she was humiliated and feared for her life when the Ohio officer allegedly assaulted her.","In an interview on Friday with WEWS, Euclid, Ohio resident Shajuan Gray, 46, described in detail what she said happened on March 27, 2017, when Officer James Aoki came to her apartment.",Gray said she was in the shower when she heard a knock on the door that day.,She came out with a towel on and saw Aoki outside. She cracked the door open and asked what was going on.,"“He started shouting he was tired of me, got complaints about me and to turn down my music,” Gray said. “Which I did because at this point I’m flabbergasted. I’m shocked, like, what is this about?”","Gray said that’s when Aoki put his foot in her door and “barged” into her apartment without probable cause. She said he then slammed her against the freezer and arrested her, leaving bruises on her body.","“As he’s slamming me and pushing me against the freezer and refrigerator, he’s twisting my arms up in an uncomfortable position,” she said. “I’m telling him then, ‘You’re hurting me. Why are you doing this to me? Please stop.’ ”","In the lawsuit, Gray alleged she was only wearing a bath wrap at the time of the incident, and it fell off while Aoki assaulted her, exposing her chest. She claimed he would not allow her to get dressed before he took her to the police department. ",You can read the lawsuit below: ,,Aoki did not have a body camera on during the incident.,"Later, an assisting officer arrived, who was wearing a body camera. That video showed Gray walking down the stairs of her apartment in handcuffs wearing only a towel. She can be heard asking to be allowed to put on clothes and telling officers they're hurting her. ","“So at this point, I’m screaming and yelling with all the mixed emotions going on, crying, just in disbelief that this was happening,” Gray said. “[I was] humiliated, embarrassed, disrespected, everything. Just ashamed.”","Gray also said after Aoki arrested her, he slammed her against the police cruiser.",She said she feared for her life.,"“This is the point where I’m asking him and telling him, ‘Please let me get dressed.’ And I’m still saying, ‘You’re hurting me.’ Nothing. This man had nothing in his eyes,” she said. “It was just the worst day of my life.”","After the incident, Gray filed a complaint with the Euclid Police Department. WEWS investigators obtained a copy of the complaint,as well as the findings of the police's internal investigation.","These findings include Aoki's account of what happened. He said he responded to Gray's apartment on a criminal complaint of ""excessive noise"" called in by another resident, and heard the loud music coming from her residence.",Police said Gray refused to provide her name and tried to shut the door on the officer. Police also alleged Aoki attempted to arrest Gray and she resisted. ,"""You continued to resist and the officer used the force necessary to take you into custody,"" the findings said, in part. ""It was unfortunate that your turbulent behavior caused you to have a wardrobe malfunction, although, according to video footage and in opposition to your statement, your top was up and your breasts were not exposed when you were escorted outside of the apartment complex in handcuffs.""","The internal investigation found Gray's complaint to be ""not sustained.""","Gray was acquitted of the charges filed against her stemming from the incident, which included resisting arrest, obstruction of official business and noise violation charges.","Her lawsuit, which alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution and excessive force, said Gray suffered and continues to suffer physical, emotional and psychological injuries, as well as economic losses.","The injuries suffered by Gray were ""preventable"" had Aoki ""not engaged in unconstitutional conduct in violation of her fundamental rights,” the complaint said.","In addition, the lawsuit alleges the City of Euclid failed to ""effectively"" investigate the incident or discipline Aoki for ""illegal behavior"" and ""false testimony.""",WEWS reviewed city records and found Aoki has been involved in 15 other incidents involving the use of force since 2016 — the eighth highest number of any officer within the police department.,Gray’s lawsuit was the sixth filed against the city for excessive force in the last two years.,Euclid Police has not responded to WEWS's multiple requests for comment.

"Recordings of police brutality have undermined the public's perceptions of law enforcement—and changed how Americans see ""good cops"" and ""bad cops.""","Until I was 11, I trusted police officers, for reasons that Hans Fiene captures in The Federalist. ""For many conservatives, especially those of us living in nice, comfy suburbs, it’s hard to apply the 'power corrupts' doctrine to law enforcement because we’ve never seen corrupted enforcers of the law,"" he writes. ""We’ve never been wrongly arrested. We’ve never witnessed our children put in jail based on the false reports of police officers. We’ve never seen our neighbors beaten or tased without cause. And in the extremely unlikely scenario that a police officer drove into our neighborhood and murdered our unarmed friend in cold blood, we cannot possibly fathom a scenario where the justice system wouldn’t be on our side and where that police officer wouldn’t spend the rest of his life in jail.""","Personal experience shapes attitudes more powerfully than anything else. But it wasn't a run-in with the law that changed me. Video killed my trust in police officers. On March 3, 1991, or shortly thereafter, I watched a TV news report like this one:","Until that day, my 11-year-old's notion of race in America included an awareness  of slavery, which seemed like ancient history; knowledge of Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks as venerated heroes from the distant past; and the Cosby family from the eponymous TV show, who established my notion of a contemporary black family. Then the Rodney King beating happened an hour's drive from my house, and less than six months later, after an overwhelmingly white jury acquitted the police officers who did the beating, the L.A. riots began. These events forced suburban Californians my age to confront parts of reality we'd never imagined. I couldn't grok why police officers would attack a man like that, or how a jury could acquit them, but I'd seen it with my own eyes. The incident didn't turn me against all law enforcement, but I started to believe that there were good cops and bad cops. Soon after, I was in the car with my mom when she got pulled over for a speeding ticket and wondered, slightly fearfully, if we'd get a bad cop. The officer turned out to be perfectly polite, of course. I didn't yet understand that he might or might not have behaved the same if we'd been a black family. ","As events in Ferguson, Missouri unfold, several observers have noticed that ""this time is different."" Unlike during past instances of police officers killing or assaulting young black men in suspicious though not yet demonstrably criminal circumstances, some prominent conservatives are doubting the official police narrative or criticizing their militarized response to protesters. Some attribute this to a growing libertarian influence in the GOP, and it's no accident that Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has offered one of the strongest calls for police reform.","My colleagues Peter Beinart and Ross Douthat persuasively argue that falling crime has made the American public less inclined to reflexively side with police, which has changed political incentives. Douthat posits that this is a generational shift.","But when it comes to how reflexively or instinctively cops are presumed to be truthful and honorable, the importance of video shouldn't be discounted. A generation ago, footage of police officers in the Deep South turning snarling dogs and firehoses on Civil Rights protesters made a deep impression on my parents, even though they grew up a continent away in an overwhelmingly white suburb where their personal experiences would've made police behaving that way seem unfathomable. Watching Jim Crow's enforcers with their own eyes couldn't be ignored. If anyone thought in 1991 that such brutality was a vestige of the past, or something that could only happen among racist cops in the South, the Rodney King tape disabused them of that notion, kicking off an era of cheap, increasingly ubiquitous recording equipment that was bound to capture more police misbehavior.","Of course young people growing up with YouTube will trust police officers less. The many videos of brutality don't lie—and they confirm that, sometimes, cops do lie. ","Even more often, they hold their tongues.","""Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances,"" Senator Paul wrote in his op-ed. ""There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement."" He went on to talk about police militarization. But there is another systemic problem in law enforcement. Even good people in uniform routinely fail to report on bad colleagues. They don't engage in certain unsavory behavior themselves. But when other cops do, they look the other way. Nearly every law enforcement agency in America has within its ranks an unofficial code of loyalty to good and bad officers alike.","This is evident in the Rodney King tape. As Peter Jennings said way back in 1991, it was ""a story that might never have surfaced if someone wouldn't have picked up his home video camera""—a judgment he rendered, and that we all know to be true, despite the fact that there weren't just five officers beating on King, there were also numerous other police officers standing around watching. This is a pattern that repeats itself again and again in documented instances of police abuse. My colleague Ta-Nehisi Coates has addressed the canard that black people ignore black-on-black violence. I'd only add that I've heard a lot more denunciations of black-on-black violence from black people, black leaders—hell, even black rappers—than I've heard rank-and-file police officers denouncing ""blue-on-black"" or even ""blue-on-white"" violence perpetrated by fellow officers. The only such statements I can ever recall came from police brass under political pressure to distance themselves from underlings caught misbehaving. I don't necessarily think police officers are less likely than people in other professions to tell on misbehaving colleagues. But the stakes are rather different, and their job is to enforce the rules, even when fellow officers break them.","Take another look at the police officer who pepper-sprayed the peaceful student protest at UC Davis. Eventually he lost his job for this act, after months of near universal denunciation. But instead of watching him this time, look at how many of his colleagues are standing around, some of them averting their eyes, none objecting:",Take another look at the moment when NYPD Deputy Inspector Anthony Balonga pepper-sprays a small group of captive women already corralled by other officers:,That is a man supremely confident that his nearby NYPD colleagues will neither stop him nor file a complaint about his abuse of protestors who posed no threat to anyone. But for the fact that he was caught on video he never would've been disciplined.,"Heather MacDonald of City Journal, who has reported on police departments all over the United States, regularly assures readers that the NYPD is one of the best in the nation. Yet when NYPD officer Adrian Schoolcraft spent months secretly recording evidence of legal violations and policy violations in the 81st precinct, he wasn't documenting behavior that had already been reported to internal affairs and investigated. Other cops were likely bothered by misbehavior that was going on. But he was the only one to expose it. Other police officers knew that if they objected aggressively they'd be risking their jobs, or their status among fellow officers, or their chances for advancement, so they kept quiet. That doesn't make them bad people. It does make them an illustration of why police officers cannot be reflexively trusted by the public: powerful incentives regularly cause them to show greater loyalty to colleagues than the public, a pattern that exists in just about every institution. Police officers should be no more and no less trusted than Catholic priests, Penn State football coaches, or GM recall managers.","Yet they're often afforded a presumption that their version of events is true, no matter how many times individual cops are caught falsifying reports or lying on the stand. ","In that item from The Federalist quoted at the beginning of this article, Hans Fiene urges conservatives who reflexively trust the police to show a bit more skepticism. ""Police brutality is not the Bogeyman,"" he writes. ""It’s not an urban legend witnessed by none but told by many. It’s not a myth created by a primitive tribe that is too simple to understand the true source of the brokenness in its communities. Black people believe in police brutality for the same reason they believe in rain—because they’ve felt it ... For those of us who have never experienced law enforcement corrupted by power, basic human decency should require that we try to understand and consider the perspective of those who have...""","That's true. But trusting that minority groups aren't fabricating police misconduct isn't even as necessary as it was for, say, the white suburbanite of 1985, limited by what he'd seen with his eyes, read in the local paper, or watched on CBS. Any doubt that excessive force by law enforcement is a widespread problem can now be laid to rest in a single hour with nothing more than access to YouTube.","Start here or here or here. Or here. Or here. Or here. If you keep searching, you'll come to the conclusion that this sort of violence is epidemic long before you run out of video confirmation. Then remember the vast majority of these incidents are never videotaped. ","The answer isn't to stop respecting all police officers, or to assume that any allegation of police misconduct is true. Even officers involved in suspicious killings, like the one in Ferguson, Missouri, deserve a fair hearing from the public. No one knows for sure what happened when Mike Brown was killed, and while the reaction of local police to protesters does not inspire confidence, the objective ought to be an impartial, accurate investigation by a credible, independent party.","But in the age of YouTube and Google, where police brutality can be seen from the comfort of one's home, along with documentation from dozens of serious law enforcement scandals, there is no longer any valid excuse for being blind to bad cops generally, or denying the possibility that an officer could have callously killed an unarmed man. ","In my generation, an increasing number of people will reach the conclusion that when a dispute arises pitting the word of law enforcement against the word of the policed, they ought to be on equal footing—disputes should be adjudicated by dispassionately weighing the available evidence, not reflexively giving police officers a benefit of the doubt that their profession, as a collective, has not earned (although you wouldn't know it from police brass, judges, and district attorneys). As the police continue to lose the trust of the public, due largely to documented instances of bad behavior by fellow officers, as well as law enforcement's longstanding inability to police themselves, I suspect that more and more good cops will be clamoring for cameras on their dashboards and lapels. Until then, citizens ought to record police during every incident as it unfolds. Doing so will bring vindication to good cops and indictments of bad cops. ",Don't trust.

"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A police dog handler has been suspended without pay for five days but won't face criminal charges after his dog was left in a police vehicle for more than six hours and died from the South Carolina heat, Columbia Police Chief Skip Holbrook said.","Master Police Officer David Hurt had the air conditioning on, but for some unexplained reason turned off a heat alarm and left his windows open July 26. Hurt failed to even come to his vehicle to let the Labrador retriever mix named ""Turbo"" use the bathroom — behavior that shocked seasoned dog handlers, Holbrook said.","""He didn't give any logical reason,"" Holbrook said at a news conference.","The chief also presented the findings of the internal investigation to prosecutors, who decided that Hurt used terrible judgment but wasn't criminally negligent and no charges should be filed.","""It was a mistake of the heart he will have to deal with the rest of his life,"" said Holbrook, who added he didn't fire Hurt because he immediately took responsibility for his grave error.",Hurt also will be suspended from the bomb squad and can never handle a police dog again.,"Turbo was the first dog given to Hurt, who was selected to be a handler and went through hundreds of hours of training. The 22-month-old explosive-sniffing dog had been with Hurt for seven months.","Hurt was at a high school July 26, getting active shooter training, and didn't take the dog inside because of the loud noises and crowd, Holbrook said.","Other handlers also left dogs inside vehicles because they could be needed for a call on a moment's notice but they all checked on their animals frequently, the chief said.","When Hurt returned to his vehicle at the end of the day, Turbo had white foam around his mouth and was listless. Hurt immediately recognized the dog was suffering from heat stress and took it to a veterinarian. The dog was put to sleep two days later after suffering organ failure, Holbrook said","The high temperature in Columbia that day was 94 degrees (34 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. Investigators don't know the temperature in Hurt's vehicle because he immediately went to the vet, the police chief said.","Hurt accepted the punishment and remains heartbroken at what happened, Holbrook said. He has children who loved the dog.","""It's like losing a partner or a family member,"" the chief said. ""It is devastating.""","Holbrook estimated the police department lost about $25,000 in training and other expenses from the dog's death.",___,Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.

"," The target is the Minhas Air Base in the town of Kamra, located around 40 miles outside Islamabad.

Saeed Shah wrote at the time: ","Pakistan's nuclear sites are tightly guarded. While experts do not think that terrorists could seize an actual nuclear bomb — the weapons are not kept in a useable form, with parts dispersed — it is possible that they could cause a fire or explosion inside a nuclear site, or perhaps seize radioactive material.","UPDATE: 2 soldiers and 6 militants have been left dead from the fighting,  Reuters reports.

"CHICAGO (CN) – The Seventh Circuit denied immunity Thursday to a police officer who shot a truck driver he’d been brawling with after the man put his hands in the air and twice said, “I surrender.”","“We cannot read the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and, on the record as it presently stands, conclude as a matter of law that the officer is entitled to qualified immunity,” U.S. Circuit Judge Michael Scudder wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. “Doing so would mark a stark departure from clearly established law regarding an officer’s use of deadly force.”","In 2013, Craig Strand, a truck driver, stopped his truck in Merrillville, Indiana, to take a mandatory drug screening. Unable to find parking at the drug testing facility, he asked for and received permission to park his truck at a nearby Planned Parenthood office.","Officer Curtis Minchuk was working security at Planned Parenthood, in uniform.","Unaware that Strand had authorization to park there, Minchuk wrote Strand two parking tickets.","When Strand came back to his truck, he attempted to explain his situation to the policeman, but Officer Minchuk allegedly asked for a bribe.","Strand refused to pay, and took out his phone to take pictures showing the absence of no-parking signs in order to contest the tickets.","At this point, Minchuk allegedly ordered Strand to leave immediately, and Strand said he would leave as soon as he was done taking pictures.","Minchuk said, “I told you to get the f*** outta here,” slapped Strand’s cell phone to the ground, and tore his shirt off his body, according to court records.","The policeman demanded Strand’s ID, and Strand countered by demanding Minchuk’s badge number.","The argument escalated into a full-on brawl, with both men hitting each other on the ground. Strand punched Minchuk at least three times in the face, and put his hands around the officer’s throat.","But, court records show, it was Strand who ended the fight when he stood up, backed away 4 to 6 feet, put his hands up and said, “I surrender. Do whatever you think you need to do. I surrender, I’m done.”",Minchuk responded by shooting Strand in the abdomen.,"Strand survived the shooting, and was later convicted of battery of a police officer.","He filed a civil rights lawsuit against Minchuk and the town of Merrillville, and a federal judge refused to grant Minchuk immunity for his use of deadly force.","The Seventh Circuit affirmed Thursday, finding that, “For Minchuk to prevail at this stage, the record must show that he fired while Strand still posed a threat. Instead, the record shows that Strand had backed away, voiced his surrender, and up to five, ten, or fifteen seconds may have elapsed while Strand stood with his hands in the air.”",Judge Scudder’s 16-page opinion was joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Michael Kanne and Amy St. Eve. All three judges on the panel are Republican appointees.,"“Strand’s confrontation with Officer Minchuk involved no high‐speed car and foot chase, no report of a violent crime, and no reason to believe an offender was armed,” Scudder wrote. “Here…the circumstances are unclear such that we cannot discern with any confidence whether Strand continued to pose a threat to Officer Minchuk.”"

The 8-1 decision overruling three lower courts was written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Samuel Alito dissented, calling a Virginia police officer's actions reasonable.",A link has been sent to your friend's email address.,A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. ,To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs,"The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that police need a search warrant to search a car on private property.(Photo: Michael Owens, USAT)",WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that police generally cannot enter private property to search a motor vehicle without first obtaining a warrant.,"The 8-1 decision overruling three lower courts was written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Samuel Alito dissented, calling a Virginia police officer's actions reasonable when he walked up a private driveway to confirm that a motorcycle had been stolen.","The stolen motorcycle had outrun two different police officers from the same Virginia department in 2013. So when Officer David Rhodes examined what he suspected was the same motorcycle under a tarp in a driveway, he waited patiently for Ryan Collins to come home, then placed him under arrest.","The high court ruled that same year that police need a warrant to search outside a private home. But automobiles are exempt from most Fourth Amendment privacy protections if a crime is suspected, because they can be moved quickly and are highly regulated. In Collins' case, those two precedents collided.",Sotomayor and seven colleagues resolved the collision in favor of privacy. ,"""The automobile exception does not permit an officer without a warrant to enter a home or its curtilage in order to search a vehicle therein,"" Sotomayor ruled. ""The scope of the automobile exception extends no further than the automobile itself.""","During oral argument, Chief Justice John Roberts said motor vehicles don't get the same privacy rights as houses because they can be driven away at a moment's notice. To make his point, he cited the famous race car from the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off — mistakenly recalling it as a Porsche when in fact it was a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spider.","But Roberts joined Sotomayor's opinion Tuesday, leaving only Alito in dissent. Alito said the vehicle exception should apply as long as the search isn't unreasonable or a significant breach of privacy. ","""An ordinary person of common sense would react to the court’s decision the way Mr. Bumble famously responded when told about a legal rule that did not comport with the reality of everyday life,"" Alito said, quoting a Charles Dickens character: ""If that is the law, he exclaimed, 'the law is a ass — a idiot.'""",Judge Clarence Thomas joined the majority's conclusion but expressed concern about the potential result -- that evidence against Collins would be excluded at trial. He said the court may lack the authority to impose the federal exclusionary rule on states. ,The Supreme Court in recent years has been a firm defender of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. It has held that police cannot use GPS equipment to track vehicles or search cellphones without a warrant.,"Earlier this term in a pending case, the justices voiced concerns about government monitoring of suspects by tracking the location of their cellphones.","And on the same day that they heard Collins' case, they also considered a privacy challenge from a driver found with 49 bricks of heroin in the trunk of a car rented under someone else's name. The justices ruled that his privacy was invaded as well.", 
"Eric Boehm|May. 7, 2018 2:55 pm","When police in Rialto, California, received a report of three black women carrying luggage out of a suburban home, they responded with a show of force that included several cruisers and a helicopter.",The women were merely checking out of their Airbnb.,"Video of the incident posted to social media accounts by one of the women shows a number of police cars surrounding a black SUV. In a Facebook post, Kells Fyffe-Marshall says seven cop cars surrounded the vehicle and shut down the street as she and her friends were trying to leave.","""The officers came out of their cars demanding us to put our hands in the air,"" Fyffe-Marshall writes. (She does not say whether any guns were drawn.) ""They informed us that there was also a helicopter tracking us. They locked down the neighborhood and had us standing in the street.""","Why the aggressive response? In the video, one of the police officers can be heard explaining that a neighbor reported ""three black people stealing stuff. Like breaking into the house and stealing stuff.""","After being told that they were only removing their own luggage from the house, the cop admits, ""That's possible, but you never know.""","Fyffe-Marshall says it took more than 45 minutes to resolve the misunderstanding, during which time the police accused them of lying and claimed they had never heard of Airbnb before. Even after being presented with booking confirmations and even after talking to the owner of the house on the phone, the police continued to detain the three women for what they said was a ""felony charge.""","""We have been dealing with different emotions and you want to laugh about this but it's not funny. The trauma is real. I've been angry, fustrated and sad,"" Fyffe-Marhsall wrote. ""This is insanity.""",,"Did race play a role here? Fyffe-Marshall thinks so. She calls the incident ""racial profiling"" and suggests that a group of white women would not have had the cops called on them in the first place. The evidence suggests that she has a point, though we don't have the benefit of knowing why the neighbor acted as she did, or whether the cops would have more quickly admitted their mistake after confronting a group with skin of a different color.","But whether or not racism was at work, this was a clear case of institutionalized paranoia. The neighbor who called the cops was doing exactly what all those ""see something, say something"" ads are always reminding us to do: assume the worst about a seemingly innocuous event. Nosy neighbors have been around for as long as human beings have lived in communities, but now they are encouraged to do more than gossip.","Meanwhile, the cops' response—seven cars and a freaking helicopter—shows that a police department ready to go head-to-head with dangerous thieves engaged in a brazen daylight robbery. There was no attempt to ascertain whether the phone call was legitimate, no apparent procedure to have a patrol car check out the scene and call for backup if needed. These police go straight from zero to 100 at the drop of hat. This is the same mentality that has SWAT teams beating down doors to deliver warrants and officers diving out of their cars, guns drawn, to confront a child with a toy. Call in the helicopter, because every possible threat must be treated like the most serious one ever faced. It's easy to imagine how the incident could have spiraled into something more tragic.","It's a bit crazy to suggest that these officers deserve any credit for only detaining three people for 45 minutes and calling in a helicopter, rather than just killing someone. But if this is typical police work in Rialto, that may be where we are.","Update: Marie Rodriguez, the 45-year-old woman who owns the home Fyffe-Marshall was renting via Airbnb, tells Reason there was a fourth person—a Canadian man—staying there last week. As for the police response, Rodriguez says she does not believe it was overly aggressive.","""They were just doing their job,"" Rodriguez says.",Photo Credit: Deano / Splash News/Newscom,Eric Boehm is a reporter at Reason.,Eric Boehm is a reporter at Reason.,"

Then the police acquired a helicopter. Now, when a noise complaint is called in, the helicopter's dispatched to circle over the neighborhood, beaming its spotlight down onto the house and its surroundings, while the loudspeaker booms out orders for everyone to go home, in the process awakening everyone within a quarter-mile of the house.

"PARKLAND, Fla. - Several parents of victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre said that if former Broward Sheriff's Office Deputy Scot Peterson, who stood outside the school for several minutes while bullets rang out, had done his job, their children might not have lost their lives.
                     ""I think Peterson is the lowest form of life available,"" said Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was gunned down on the third floor. ""My daughter would be alive if not for him.""

            Parkland students return to Washington to keep pressure on
            





Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel publicly criticized Peterson for his inaction during the shooting that left 17 dead and others wounded, but he didn't fire the 54-year-old deputy, instead allowing him to resign. Local 10 News caught up with Peterson outside his home in Boynton Beach, where he is living on his $100,000-a-year public pension. The deputy, who had yet to face any media, simply turned and hurried inside, saying only, ""Don't come on my property."" 
                     But now, a report that recently surfaced has some victims' families calling for a renewed investigation of Peterson for a case he handled four years to the day prior to the massacre. The case involved two 17-year-old students bullying a 14-year-old freshman, with one holding down the younger boy by his ankles while the other kicked the victim, grabbed his genitals and then took the victim's own baseball bat and began shoving it against his buttocks, simulating rape, through the boy's clothes. 
                     One of those assailants, the boy who allegedly held down the victim, was Israel's son, Brett. Defense attorney Alex Arreaza, who represents shooting victim Anthony Borges, who was shot five times in the Valentine's Day massacre but survived, said the case could have led to felony charges. 
                     ""He could be charged with a lewd and lascivious, and I'm being conservative,"" Arreaza said.  
                     Peterson claims in the report that it was a ""simple battery"" under the board's discipline matrix, and he decided to give both of the boy's attackers a three-day suspension. 
                     ""What is that? Is that like an alternative universe law?"" Arreaza said. ""What happens? Because you're in the school you don't have to obey regular laws?""

Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel publicly criticized Peterson for his inaction during the shooting that left 17 dead and others wounded, but he didn't fire the 54-year-old deputy, instead allowing him to resign. Local 10 News caught up with Peterson outside his home in Boynton Beach, where he is living on his $100,000-a-year public pension. The deputy, who had yet to face any media, simply turned and hurried inside, saying only, ""Don't come on my property."" 
                     But now, a report that recently surfaced has some victims' families calling for a renewed investigation of Peterson for a case he handled four years to the day prior to the massacre. The case involved two 17-year-old students bullying a 14-year-old freshman, with one holding down the younger boy by his ankles while the other kicked the victim, grabbed his genitals and then took the victim's own baseball bat and began shoving it against his buttocks, simulating rape, through the boy's clothes. 
                     One of those assailants, the boy who allegedly held down the victim, was Israel's son, Brett. Defense attorney Alex Arreaza, who represents shooting victim Anthony Borges, who was shot five times in the Valentine's Day massacre but survived, said the case could have led to felony charges. 
                     ""He could be charged with a lewd and lascivious, and I'm being conservative,"" Arreaza said.  
                     Peterson claims in the report that it was a ""simple battery"" under the board's discipline matrix, and he decided to give both of the boy's attackers a three-day suspension. 
                     ""What is that? Is that like an alternative universe law?"" Arreaza said. ""What happens? Because you're in the school you don't have to obey regular laws?"" 
                     In fact, the disciplinary matrix includes ""sexual misconduct"" and ""serious"" battery, both of which, arguably, apply in this case.
                     ""You will never see somebody grabbing somebody's crotch and poking some kid in the butt with a bat and getting a simple battery for it,"" Arreaza said when asked if he believed the sheriff's son received preferential treatment.

Jesus Campos found the mass murderer's location—and drew his fire—before cops or SWAT arrived.,"Update: On October 9, 2017, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joe Lombardo amended previous statements to clarify that Jesus Campos was shot before Stephen Paddock opened fire on concert-goers. Campos remains credited with informing police of Paddock's location. Campos was was shot at 9:59 p.m. Lombardo said, and Paddock began firing on the crowd six minutes later. ",LAS VEGAS—Jesus Campos had no firearm when he found Stephen Paddock and approached his room on the 32rd floor of Mandalay Bay on Sunday night. ,"Paddock, who had rigged cameras in the hallway and on the peephole of the door, saw Campos coming and fired through the door, hitting him in the leg, said Dave Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America. The union represents Campos and hundreds of security guards at Mandalay Bay. ","When Campos was hit, he radioed casino dispatch and told them his location—and Paddock’s. ","“We received information via their dispatch center… that helped us locate where this individual was sequestered,” Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Tuesday.","When Campos first arrived on the 32nd floor, he did so by elevator because Paddock had somehow blocked stairwell doors leading to the hallway outside of his room, Hickey said.","He had come the floor to respond to an open door alarm, Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said at a press conference on Friday, when Paddock shot Campos in the leg. McMahill praised Campos, and called for more recognition for the man who made it possible for police to located Paddock.","“I want to say today that I don't think we've a good enough job recognizing him and his actions and for that I apologize,” McMahill said. “I just want to take (a) moment and clear the record that he's an absolute hero.”","Police officers subsequently approached the room and were met with 200 rounds from Paddock, Lombardo said on Wednesday night. Police fell back until SWAT arrived.","Campos, wounded, stayed on the floor and even went door-to-door, clearing rooms with police, Lombardo said, until he was ordered to leave because he was wounded.","About an hour after Paddock quit firing, a SWAT team gained entry to the suite by blowing the doors off with explosives. Paddock was found dead inside from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Without Campos’ action, the mass murderer’s rampage that killed 58 people could have been even more deadly. ",Hickey lauded Campos’ bravery on Wednesday afternoon. ,"“I think we need to recognize the position that these officers hold,” Hickey said. “Security professionals in those kind of venues—whether it’s a bank or a hotel or Disney World—I’m telling you that I don’t think that our officers are recognized enough for the valuable role that they play in protecting property, people and even the nation.”","Campos was struck in the right leg where the bullet remains, Hickey said, and will be removed by surgery at a later date. Campos was well enough to try to leave the hospital not long after the shooting, but was kept there by staff and police who wanted to monitor his injury and interview him about his ordeal. ","“We just want to make sure that Mr. Campos and all of our officers are recognized for what they do every day, which is protect people,” Hickey said. ","On any given shift, 17 of 200 officers at the hotel complex are armed, Hickey said. Campos likely just had a nightstick, useless against a man who had a military-grade arsenal at his disposal.",This story has been updated with information from police about Campos' actions in finding Stephen Paddock's room.

"C.J. Ciaramella|Jul. 6, 2018 4:00 pm","Roberto Koltun/MCT/NewscomThe Miami-Dade Police Department must return nearly $20,000 in cash to a woman after prosecutors admitted that officers illegally searched her car and seized several lawfully owned guns.","The Miami Herald reports that the department will also pay $3,000 in legal fees to Lizmixell Batista, a dancer at the local Cheetah Gentleman's Club, and her husband, Ras Cates. The case is textbook example of how asset forfeiture laws and the drug war incentivize constitutional violations and bad police work.","Batista and Cates were arrested following a traffic stop in May. Police allegedly smelled marijuana in their car, and a subsequent search turned up six guns, several large bottles of what cops suspected to be codeine cough syrup, and nearly $20,000 in cash in Batista's purse.","At the time, police touted it as a major bust. CBS Miami ran an ""exclusive"" story about the ""arsenal of weapons, cash and illegal drugs"":","""It's amazing how something as simple as a traffic stop can lead us to crack a lot of cases,"" said Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta. ""A lot of serial killers are behind bars because of traffic stops. These traffic stops lead to so many things in the criminal world and they are never routine.

The department said a Miami-Dade police dog, Roxie, alerted that the cash had been ""in close proximity"" to large amounts of narcotics.","But at the hearing, a fellow stripper named Haley Heath testified that her friend, Batista, earned ""significant cash tips"" at the Cheetah club.","""I felt that the glitter on the seized cash was compelling evidence, but apparently the police department disagreed,"" said defense lawyer Jude Faccidomo.",The judge agreed with Faccidomo and ordered the cash to be returned.,Photo Credit: Roberto Koltun/MCT/Newscom,C.J.

Subscribe,For more great content,Subscribe,For more great content,A former Hall County Sheriff’s Office investigator whose job was to look into allegations of misconduct within the agency pleaded guilty Monday to sexual battery involving a 3-year-old girl.,"Former internal affairs investigator Michael D. Nix, 44, who was one of two deputies in the sheriff’s internal affairs division in 2009 when he was charged, entered the guilty plea for a felony charges of sexual battery and false statement.","Nix will serve 10 years of probation for the two charges and pay $3,000 plus court costs. He was booked into the Hall County Jail in July 2009 on one count of aggravated child molestation.","That charge, along with two additional charges of child molestation and another false statement charge, were dropped.","Nix will complete an anger management evaluation and must remain on the sexual offender list for at least 10 years, according to court documents signed by Superior Court Judge Kathlene Gosselin.","Under probation conditions for sex offenders, Nix will have no contact with any child under 18 “whether directly in person or indirectly through any means of communication or through employment, volunteer activity or otherwise.”",He also cannot reside with any child under 18 or create or possess a photograph of a minor other than his own children and immediate family members.,"He cannot consume alcohol or drugs during probation and must keep a driving log. He will “never drive alone through parks, playgrounds or school zones where children are commonly known to be,” according to court documents.","Agents with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation brought the charges against Nix after investigating a complaint from the parents of a 3-year-old girl, according to Hall County Sheriff’s Col. Jeff Strickland.","The girl had stayed in Nix’s Clermont home while his wife was baby-sitting her. The girl told her parents what happened and was later interviewed at a center for child victims of sexual abuse, Strickland said.","Nix had been with the sheriff’s office for 20 years, working his way up the ranks from a road deputy to investigations. In the internal affairs division, he investigated other deputies within the agency for possible rules violations and misconduct.","After the arrest, Nix was terminated and jailed, Strickland said."
"Damon Root|Sep. 13, 2018 9:45 am","C-SPANIn 2015, Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion in the case of Klayman v. Obama in which he argued that the National Security Agency's bulk metadata collection program ""is entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment."" Is that still his view today? Does Kavanaugh, who is now a Supreme Court nominee, continue to believe that the Fourth Amendment suffers no violation when the federal government engages in the wholesale warrantless collection of every Americans' telephone record metadata?","During a brief but telling exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) at his confirmation hearings last week, Kavanaugh gave the impression that his thinking on the matter has in fact changed.","""In your concurrence in Klayman v. Obama,"" Leahy said to Kavanaugh, you ""went out of your way to say that not only is the dragnet collection of America's telephone records by the National Security Agency OK because it is not a search…even if it is a search, it is justified in order to prevent terrorism."" Why?","Kavanaugh began his response by invoking precedent. ""I was trying to articulate what I thought based on the precedent at the time—at the time when your information went to a third party and the government obtained the information from the third party the existing Supreme Court precedent was that your privacy interest was essentially zero,"" he said.","But then Kavanaugh pivoted to the present. ""The opinion for the Supreme Court by Chief Justice Roberts this past spring in the Carpenter case is a game changer,"" he told Leahy. ""I've talked repeatedly in this hearing about how technology will be one of the huge issues with the Fourth Amendment going forward, and you see Chief Justice Roberts' majority opinion in Carpenter, that alters, and really is a game changer, from the precedent on which I was writing at that time.""","In his majority opinion in Carpenter v. United States, Chief Justice Roberts ruled that warrantless government tracking of a cellphone user via his cellphone location records violated the Fourth Amendment. ""A person does not surrender all Fourth Amendment protection by venturing into the public sphere,"" Roberts wrote. ""We decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carrier's database of physical location information.""","Sen. Leahy then asked the SCOTUS nominee a follow-up question: ""Do you think if Carpenter had been decided you would have written the concurrence you did in Klayman?""","""I don't see how I could have,"" Kavanaugh replied.","Leahy appeared pleased with that answer. ""Thank you,"" he said. ""I agree with that.""","Leahy has some cause to be pleased. After all, it's notable that Kavanaugh did not simply describe Carpenter as a new precedent and therefore entitled to the normal level of respect under principles of stare decisis; rather, Kavanaugh called Carpenter a ""game changer,"" suggesting that the ruling might have influenced his own thinking. If that turns out to be the case, it would be welcome news for Fourth Amendment advocates.",Damon Root is a senior editor of Reason magazine and the author of Overruled: The Long War for Control of the U.S. Supreme Court (Palgrave Macmillan).,Damon Root is a senior editor of Reason magazine and the author of Overruled: The Long War for Control of the U.S. Supreme Court (Palgrave Macmillan).,"

Make PoliceOne your homepage ,"If you need further help setting your homepage, check your browser’s Help menu",A judge has rejected a deputy's claim that he had no duty to confront the gunman during the school shooting in Parkland,,"By Terry Spencer and Curt Anderson
Associated Press","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A judge has rejected a deputy's claim that he had no duty to confront the gunman during the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.","Refusing to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a parent of a victim, Broward Circuit Judge Patti Englander Henning found after a hearing Wednesday that ex-deputy Scot Peterson did have a duty to protect those inside school where 17 people died and 17 were wounded on Feb. 14. Video and other evidence shows Peterson, the only armed officer at the school, remained outside while shots rang out.","The negligence lawsuit was filed by Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed. He said it made no sense for Peterson's attorneys to argue that a sworn law enforcement officer with a badge and a gun had no requirement to go inside.","""Then what is he doing there?"" Pollack said after the ruling. ""He had a duty. I'm not going to let this go. My daughter, her death is not going to be in vain.""","Peterson attorney Michael Piper said he understands that people might be offended or outraged at his client's defense, but he argued that as a matter of law, the deputy had no duty to confront the shooter. Peterson did not attend the hearing.","""There is no legal duty that can be found,"" Piper said. ""At its very worst, Scot Peterson is accused of being a coward. That does not equate to bad faith.""","The ruling came as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission began considering proposals including whether to arm trained, volunteer teachers; make it harder for outsiders to enter Florida's nearly 4,000 public schools; mandate armed security on all campuses with explicit orders to confront shooters; improve communication systems on campus; and impose more statewide uniformity in how troubled students are identified, helped and, if necessary, dealt with by police.","The commission must file its initial report to Gov. Rick Scott, incoming Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature by Jan. 1.","During its periodic meetings since April, the 15-member commission has learned that the suspected gunman, former Stoneman Douglas student Nikolas Cruz, 20, had a long history of disturbing behavior, including threats to shoot up the campus.","Minutes before the shooting, Cruz was recorded entering campus through an unguarded gate and then going into a classroom building. Investigators say he fired down the hallway and through door windows into first-floor classrooms where students didn't or couldn't hide. He climbed to the third floor to continue the attack, where students and teachers didn't know what happened two stories below.","That's because teachers couldn't quickly communicate with administrators, each other, or law enforcement. Loudspeakers could only be heard inside classrooms. Teachers, trying to secure their classrooms, could only lock the doors from the outside.","In addition to Peterson's failure to confront the gunman, there were no kits to stop the wounded's bleeding, and responding officers from different law enforcement agencies couldn't easily communicate over the radio to coordinate a counterattack and share information.","The commission includes law enforcement, education and mental health professionals, a legislator and the fathers of two slain students. It will continue meeting after Jan. 1 and make additional recommendations.","Cruz has pleaded not guilty, but his lawyers have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.","

Image: Jerry Jackson / Baltimore Sun via Getty Images,Dragana Kaurin is a human rights researcher and executive director of Localization Lab.,"“Seeing it now, it’s surreal. I don’t believe it sometimes.” Kevin Moore paused for a long time, then added “I can’t get past the screams. It’s the first thing you hear in the video, Freddie screaming. When they showed the video in court they played it on mute.”","I had watched the video again, right before our interview. Freddie Gray’s agonizing cries for help as he is being carried to the police van, his legs dragging on the ground, are haunting. The prosecution had argued that the audio was irrelevant to the case.","The violent arrest of Freddie Gray on April 12th, 2015 was caught on camera by several people, but it was Gray’s friend Moore who filmed the video that would later be shown by media outlets and in court. What Moore didn’t know then was that this was just the beginning of his encounters with Baltimore police. What followed was months of police harassment, intimidation, doxing, and a false arrest after filming the Freddie Gray video.","“Those cops used to hang out outside my job, at my kid’s school, in front of the house, they’d hold their phone cameras up when I’d pass by,” he explained.","While their videos have sparked protests and community action, people behind other high-profile videos of police killings of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Philando Castile, and Alton Sterling have also alleged retaliation from police for filming them. Like Moore, each of them told me stories of false arrests, intimidation, physical violence, doxxing, and illegal confiscation of their phones after filming or sharing videos of police misconduct. ","WITNESS, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit that supports activists who document human rights abuses, has analyzed numerous instances of police retaliation against the people who filmed or shared these videos. ","“We have heard everything from devices being illegally searched and confiscated, to bystanders being falsely accused of assaulting officers or interfering with an investigation,” Jackie Zammuto, US program manager of the organization, told me on the phone. ","Then there are the more extreme cases of Moore and Ramsey Orta, who filmed the fatal police encounters with Eric Garner. “[They] have been repeatedly targeted and harassed by law enforcement because of the videos they filmed,” said Zammuto.","During one of several stops the police van made after the arrest, a second neighbor filmed the officers placing leg shackles on Gray’s limp body. When commanding officer William G. Porter arrived at the scene, the neighbor called out to him “Hey Porter! That’s not cool, you’ve got to get him an ambulance.” Officer Porter walked toward the neighbor and took out his stun gun, threatening to use it if he didn't leave. Surveillance video confirms the account of the neighbor, who refused to give his name in an interview with the  Baltimore Sun, fearing police retaliation.","Moore, on the other hand, went directly to Baltimore Police Internal Affairs to turn his video over, offering his testimony and cooperation. When Gray died a week later from injuries sustained in the police van, city-wide protests broke out in support of Gray and his family. As he was leaving one of the protests, and just days after speaking out about police harassment and intimidation, Moore was detained at gunpoint, without charges. Two members of Copwatch, an organization which observes and documents police misconduct, were also detained. Though he was released the same night without charges, Moore says he has since been repeatedly harassed by police. ","Moore said that the Baltimore police harassed him by releasing a surveillance photo of him on local TV and social media, asking for help in identifying him as a witness. The photo came out on April 24th, 11 days after Moore had spoken to internal investigators and gave a statement on video.","“You have to understand, where I come from, you don’t go to police” he explained. “I feel like they did that shit to make me look like a rat, to make people say, like ‘Hey, is this guy telling?,’” Moore said. “And if something happened to me, they wouldn’t be held responsible for it directly.” ","T.J. Smith, a Baltimore Police Department's chief spokesperson, explained in an email that “there didn’t seem to be a focus on Mr. Moore specifically,” but couldn’t comment further.","Moore met Orta, the man who filmed the Eric Garner video, through Copwatch two years ago, and the two have since become close friends. “Ramsey is like the brother I always wanted,” Moore said. ",Orta is currently serving a four-year sentence on weapons and drug charges that both he and Moore say are retaliatory.,"“Ramsey has been arrested dozens of times since the video. I went to every one of his court dates,” Moore added. “Cases like that, man, they railroaded him and there’s nothing we can do about it.”","Orta’s cellphone video of Eric Garner’s last moments on July 17th, 2014—which depicts an officer pinning Garner to the ground in a chokehold, asphyxiating him—has now been shared and viewed millions of times. Both he and Taisha Allen, the second bystander who filmed the incident, claim to have been subjected to harassment, physical intimidation, and unlawful arrest since filming the video. ","""Video isn’t going to make us safer, but it will tell our story. If it made us safer you wouldn’t see Eric Garner getting choked to death, you wouldn’t see Walter Scott getting shot down like a dog. But it finally tells the truth of what really happened""","Orta told Motherboard that the night of Garner’s killing, he was woken up by officers shining a flashlight into his bedroom and around his Staten Island home. He said that during one of his arrests, an officer pointed a phone at him and said “You filmed us, so now we’re filming you.” When asked for comment on allegations of retaliation against Orta and Allen via email, NYPD’s Office of the Deputy Commissioner responded “they were arrested based on probable cause and not because they filmed the Eric Garner arrest.” The NYPD did not respond to specific questions about Orta and Allen’s allegations.","The bystander videos play an important role in “empowering communities to challenge the police narrative,” according to Arthur Reed, founder of Baton Rouge-based anti-violence group Stop The Killing. Reed explained that the dangerous pattern of retaliation has made witnesses afraid to come forth with videos like these, and that the main goal of these videos is to gain public interest and reclaim their narratives, as they feel targeted by the same system that’s supposed to be prosecuting police officers they film.","“Video isn’t going to make us safer, but it will tell our story. If it made us safer you wouldn’t see Eric Garner getting choked to death, you wouldn’t see Walter Scott getting shot down like a dog. But it finally tells the truth of what really happened.” Reed added. “In Walter Scott’s case if he would have seen the person that was filming, I’m sure he would have shot him too.”","These communities have responded to police retaliation with subversive tactics to keep safe and keep filming. While some have adopted new technology like livestreaming or designing apps for filming police, others have taken on more traditional tactics such as delaying video release and releasing them through proxies.", Delaying Release,"Because police have repeatedly lied in the aftermath of shootings—often saying a victim was ""armed"" or ""resisted""—witnesses have begun waiting until an official narrative is released before publishing their videos. By waiting until after the police have made a statement, they can show that law enforcement narratives are often not credible","“This tactic can help present a more powerful counter-narrative and sharply juxtapose inconsistencies or lies in the report,” said Zammuto. “We saw this tactic used effectively in both the Alton Sterling and Walter Scott cases.”","Abdullah Muflahi, who owns the convenience store where Sterling was killed, witnessed the incident and its aftermath. Sterling wasn’t just a customer to Muflahi, he was a friend. Muflahi held off releasing his own cell phone footage of the shooting until after Baton Rouge Police Department had made its statement, which said that Sterling posed an imminent danger to the officers. The department claimed Sterling was reaching for a gun in his pocket. Officers also claimed that their bodycams didn’t capture the entire incident because they became dislodged during the confrontation, though several experts claimed that it is highly unlikely both body cameras fell off at the same time.","Muflahi’s tape showed otherwise: Sterling never reached for the gun in his pocket, his hands were up, following the officer’s orders. It also appears to show the officer throwing off his body cam, countering the claim that it had fallen off on its own. Earlier in May 2017, however, the Department of Justice dropped federal charges against the two officers involved, citing insufficient evidence. The Baton Rouge District Attorney did not respond to multiple phone calls and emails requesting comment.","When backup arrived on the scene, the officers took Muflahi into custody and detained him in the back of their police car for four hours. In a phone interview, Muflahi explained that during this period he wasn’t allowed to use the restroom, and was forced to relieve himself “in plain sight, next to a neighboring building. There were people standing around, walking by, and I had no choice. They made me feel like I was the criminal.”","While Muflahi sat in the locked police car, the officers confiscated not only his store surveillance tape, but also the entire surveillance system. Police even confiscated the phone Muflahi had used to tape the shooting, but either didn’t find the video or didn’t try to delete it. ",Muflahi claims that he didn’t trust police enough to hand over the video. He told  The LA Times: “I want them to be locked into a narrative.” ,"Feidin Santana also delayed releasing his video of officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott five times in the back on April 4th, 2015. Santana was still holding his camera phone when another officer warned him to stop recording. ","""I’m not going to lie and say I never regret filming it""","Initially, Santana decided not to share the video, afraid for his own safety. But after learning that police falsely claimed Scott was shot after he reached for the officer’s Taser, Santana gave the video to Scott’s family. Contrary to the police report, Santana’s video showed Scott never reached for the officer’s Taser. Instead, officer Slager walked over and dropped it next to Scott’s lifeless body after he shot him. ","“I thought about staying anonymous,” Santana said on the TODAY show days after the shooting. ""I thought about erasing the video, just getting out of [Charleston] and living someplace else.” ","In fall of 2016, after testifying in Slager’s murder trial, Santana did just that. He told the  Daily Mail that, after receiving numerous death threats, he decided to move back to the Dominican Republic. In December 2017, Slager was found guilty on federal charges, and was sentenced to 20 years for second-degree murder.", Proxies and anonymous dissemination,"One tactic for protecting individuals who have filmed police violence is to serve as a proxy, or post the video for someone who is afraid to come forward. Stop The Killing posts videos of police misconduct that he receives from the community. Reed says that he was responsible for posting the first video of Alton Sterling the night of the shooting, which was entrusted to him by witnesses. ","“There will be consequences, and threats, and harassment” for people who post videos of police brutality online, Reed explained. “They have to think of that because they find themselves in situations they never thought of.” ","By acting as a proxy and posting these videos in his community, Reed protects those who film them. ","“If they are afraid, they should turn the footage over to someone who’s not afraid, who will post it for them, and bring it to the mainstream,” he said.","Other organizations are also helping witnesses release videos anonymously. The ACLU, for instance, released its Mobile Justice App in 2012, allowing users to release videos through the organization without revealing their identity. Daniel Kahn Gillmor, the Senior Technologist at the ACLU, says that more than 600,000 people have downloaded the app: It’s “encouraging people to feel confident in filming the police,” he added.", Live-streaming and Instant Witnesses,"Witnesses have become increasingly sophisticated in documenting police violence by streaming the encounters live via Periscope, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, turning viewers into witnesses instantly. Diamond Reynolds caught national attention last year when she streamed the aftermath of her boyfriend Philando Castile’s fatal shooting by an officer during a traffic stop in Minneapolis. When asked about the video during the officer’s trial in June 2017, she said “I wanted to make sure if I died in front of my daughter that people would know the truth.”","There have been documented cases where police have deleted witnesses’ video evidence, like that of Kianga Mwamba, who later discovered the video was saved due to auto-backup. By live-streaming it on Facebook, Reynolds minimized that risk by making the feed instantly available to her network. ","“I think that was very smart of her to live-stream it.” Reed said of her video to NPR. “That way, if they would have told her to stop recording, it wouldn't have been one of those days where they could have just made her shut her phone off.” ","The considerable risk involved in filming the police is strongly felt in these communities, making individuals too afraid of retaliation to come forward on their own. As a result, there likely exists many videos containing evidence of excessive force which challenge police narratives that we have yet to see—and still many others that we may never see at all.","“I’m not going to lie and say I never regret filming it.” Moore told me. “All the bullshit, exposing myself and my family to danger, police, and government—these motherfuckers are really dangerous and they can kill you and get away with it.” ","He recalled one night, when he was hanging out with Ramsey Orta, and the subject of regretting filming the deaths of their respective friends and speaking out against police misconduct came up. They recalled everything that’s happened to them since.","“After a long pause,” Moore said “we sort of looked at each other, like ‘Nah, fuck no, I don’t regret it. This is the shit we were destined to do, this is what I was born to do—fighting for people’s rights.”",Sign up for Motherboard Premium.

"C.J. Ciaramella|Nov. 9, 2018 12:45 am","Erin Scott/Polaris/NewscomAs one of his final moves in office before resigning Wednesday, outgoing Attorney General Jeff Sessions severely limited the Justice Department's ability to enter into court-enforced decrees to reform police departments that have shown a pattern of civil rights violations.","Sessions signed a memo, released by the Justice Department Thursday night, putting in place three new requirements for the department to enter into a so-called consent decree—a settlement between the Justice Department and a local government or agency, monitored for compliance by a judge, that stipulates how it will correct civil rights violations or other issues.","First, the memo orders all proposed consent decrees to be approved by political appointees, such as a deputy attorney general or associate attorney general. Second, proposed decrees must be accompanied by extensive memos justifying their use and cost. And third, all consent decrees must now have a sunset date. Previously, consent decrees were open-ended, terminating when the reforms were deemed completed.",The memo justifies the new rules by saying consent decrees can have a large financial costs for municipal governnments as well as raise federalism concerns.,"In a statement, Vanita Gupta, an Obama-era head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, called Sessions' memo ""a slap in the face to the dedicated career staff of the department who work tirelessly to enforce our nation's civil rights laws.""","""Jeff Sessions' parting act was another attack on the core mission of the Department of Justice,"" Gupta said. ""The memo is designed to restrict consent decrees and creates a series of increasingly higher roadblocks to render them rare and ineffective.""","Consent decrees were rarely used until the Obama administration, when the Justice Department launched a record 25 civil rights investigations into unconstitutional policing in such cities as Baltimore, Chicago, and Ferguson, Missouri.","Those investigations revealed systematic and widespread civil rights abuses by police, including excessive force, unconstitutional searches, and often overt racism. The Justice Department was enforcing 14 consent decrees when Obama left office.","Sessions was a staunch opponent of such court monitoring. He said he hadn't even read the Justice Department's scathing report on the Chicago Police Department. And in numerous public speeches, he complained that they tied the hands of police trying to clean up crime-ridden areas. He blamed the decline in police searches and stops for the sharp increase in murders and violent crime in some major cities, echoing conservative critics who dubbed the phenomenon the ""Ferguson effect.""","""One of the big things out there that's, I think, causing trouble, and where you see the greatest increase in violence and murders in cities is somehow, some way, we undermined the respect for our police and made, oftentimes, their job more difficult,"" Sessions said in his first speech after being sworn in as attorney general. ""It's not been well-received by them, and we're not seeing the kind of effective, community-based, street-based policing that we found to be so effective in reducing crime.""","Sessions almost immediately ordered a review of all ongoing consent decrees and attempted to scuttle those that had yet to be finalized, such as the one in Baltimore.","Sessions' animosity toward federal oversight of police departments ended up defining his tenure as attorney general, from his first day to his last.","In a statement, Kanya Bennett, senior legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Sessions ""has all but eliminated oversight of local law enforcement for abusive policing practices.""","""This memo ensures police departments can operate with impunity, and will not be held accountable for trampling on constitutional rights of the people they are meant to serve,"" she continued. ""This is a legacy we cannot afford — least of all our Black and brown communities, subjected to police violence daily.""",C.J. Ciaramella is a criminal justice reporter at Reason.,C.J.

Graduations have been postponed this weekend so that new officers can assist with staffing and help conduct searches for weapons and other contraband, FDC said. Probation officers, too, have been brought in.","Weekend visitations have been canceled at all 50 major institutions, including private prisons, youthful offender facilities, as well as annexes, work camps and re-entry centers. Juvenile facilities have not been affected.",It appears to be the first time in memory that the Florida prison system has been locked down for an indefinite period of time.,"For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.",#ReadLocal,"The agency has not said specifically what led to the lockdown, other than that the department had received “credible intelligence’’ that “small groups’’ of inmates were planning to cause disturbances.","“Everything we are doing is based on the safety of the institutions, the staff and the inmates,’’ said Michelle Glady, FDC spokeswoman. ","“These steps are being taken out of an abundance of caution,’’ she said.","Ron McAndrew, a former Florida prison warden who now works as a consultant, said such drastic steps are rare.",,,"“When it’s statewide — that is really serious business. They must have a verified threat of some kind to take that step,’’ he said.",FDC’s intelligence division received information that the threats may be timed to coincide with the “Millions for Prisoners’ Human Rights” rally on Saturday in Washington. The loosely organized event is being billed on social media as a way to raise awareness about mass incarceration and human rights violations in prisons across the country.,"Glady initially said on Wednesday that no “basic privileges’’ would be affected, other than visitation. However, on Thursday, the Miami Herald learned that state prisons were on a system-wide lockdown — and that all educational, vocational, rehabilitation, ministry and recreation programs had been scrubbed until further notice. Inmates are confined to their dorms, except at mealtime, FDC officials finally confirmed Thursday.","Violence among inmates — especially those in gangs — is at an all-time high in Florida prisons. Corrections officers have been stabbed and beaten, and prisoners have been killed in several clashes over the past several months. ",When it’s statewide — that is really serious business. They must have a verified threat of some kind to take that step. ,"Ron McAndrew, consultant and former warden",Staffing is stretched so thin that limits had already been placed on educational and vocational programming at many prisons.,"Prison experts point out that recreation, family visits and training programs are often the first to go when staffing levels are low, and the combination of overworked correctional officers and idle inmates often leads to security breaches."," Riots have happened in several states over the past few months. In February, inmates stormed a Delaware prison, killing an officer and seriously injuring several others during a 20-hour siege. A report issued after the riot said the prison housed too many gang members together, there were not enough officers and the cancellation of privileges, like family visits and programs, had left too many frustrated inmates with time on their hands.","Florida inmates, their families and civil rights groups have long protested the state’s poor prison conditions. Over the past year, state Rep. David Richardson, a Miami Beach Democrat, has made unannounced visits to Florida prisons and found inmates — especially in the restrictive status known as confinement — without basic necessities, such as toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste, pillows, sheets, shirts and soap. ",,"Julie Jones' short tenure as Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections has seen disturbances, death and change. In a one-on-one interview, Jones talks about charges against the system, and what she's doing to try to improve conditions. ",,,"The Herald and other media have documented systemic abuse of inmates as well as suspicious deaths, medical neglect and the mistreatment of prisoners with mental and physical disabilities.",The state has been forced to make some reforms as a result of costly civil lawsuits. ,"“Florida needs to focus on why as a response it needs to lock down its prisons — too many prisoners serving far too long sentences, too few programs and inadequate staff, and too many who are mentally disabled,’’ said Randall Berg, executive director and attorney at the Florida Justice Institute, which has successfully sued the agency for human rights abuses.","“Until Florida gets smart, we will continue to waste tax dollars on corrections which are needed elsewhere,” he said.","Florida is the nation’s third-largest prison system, behind California and Texas. FDC has 148 facilities, a budget of $2.4 billion, and more staff than any other state agency.","Everything we are doing is based on the safety of the institutions, the staff and the inmates. ","Michelle Glady, FDC spokeswoman",The department spends about $20 million a year in overtime. ,"To retain and recruit more officers, state lawmakers recently approved the first raise for corrections officers in a decade, and the agency is offering signing bonuses for new officers at institutions with serious staff shortages.","Even with the raises, however, the base pay for a state corrections will be $33,500 a year. McAndrew said the combination of low pay and high turnover has led to a perfect storm of opportunity for inmates.","“The inmates are joining gangs to protect themselves because there is not enough staff to supervise them. A corrections officer in Florida is working so much overtime that they are physically exhausted. Some of them just give up and don’t care what the inmates are doing,’’ he said.","Last year, there were violent outbursts at several Panhandle prisons in advance of a nationwide prison strike scheduled on Sept. 9 — the 45th anniversary of the deadly riot at Attica prison in New York. ","There were no serious injuries last year, but three prisons were locked down. One rebellion, at Holmes Correctional Institution, involved more than 400 inmates and caused damage to nearly every dorm. ","Glady said some of the prisons in the state’s Panhandle have been gearing up for the possibility of violence, which is one reason they’ve been put on lockdown. She said most prisoners are allowed to make phone calls — and all of them are permitted to shower and go to chow hall. Only Franklin Correctional Institution, is on full lockdown, where inmates are not receiving any privileges. She said that’s because of a more serious security concern, which she would not detail."," McAndrew said the lockdown isn’t going to prevent tension — and may exacerbate it. Florida prisons do not have air-conditioning, he pointed out.","“The summer, it gets so damn hot,’’ he said. “Imagine if you had to sleep in your bedroom or stay in your home, locked in without any air-conditioning — try it for one night. You would not be able to sleep.’’",,"A video from inside Dade Correctional Institution, which was released by the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office on March 17, 2017, shows the moment prison guards respond to a medical emergency regarding inmate Darren Rainey.

Shareholders get leftovers.,The rhetoric coming out of the employer lobby would leave one to believe that workers are somehow the guilty party in this — they simply won’t accept jobs that pay them less than they’re worth.,"The underlying cause of the “labor shortage” is hiding in plain sight. It’s the long-term trend of funneling the gains from labor productivity not to the workforce, but to shareholders. As with any addiction, this process produces short-term euphoria, reflected in share prices, but long-term pathology, reflected in income inequality, poverty and social unrest.","But it’s been going on so long that the addicts, that is, corporate CEOs and their mouthpieces, have forgotten how to respond. The CNBC piece observed, as though this is a new discovery, that “employers are going to have to start doing more to entice workers, likely through pay raises, training and other incentives.” The harvest will be lower corporate earnings, Goldman Sachs has warned.","According to the Wall Street Journal, Goldman’s economists “predict that every percentage-point increase in labor-cost inflation will drag down earnings of companies in the S&P 500 by 0.8%.” That money won’t disappear, of course—it will go into the pockets of workers, and then find its way back into the coffers of corporate America via higher sales.","The narrow attitude that wage growth is bad for business is exemplified by the pummeling that American Airlines suffered from Wall Street a year ago, when it announced healthy wage increases for pilots and flight attendants, even before their union contracts expired. As we reported at the time, the airline's shares lost more than 8% in value over the ensuing two trading sessions, a loss of about $1.9 billion in market value in 48 hours.","""Labor is being paid first again,"" Kevin Crissey, an airlines analyst for Citigroup, bellyached to clients after the announcement. “Shareholders get leftovers."" Hardly: From 2014 through 2016, American had authorized $9 billion in share buybacks to fatten the shareholders’ take. By contrast, the pay raises will cost American $1 billion over three years.","Let’s take a look at how the balance between corporate profits and labor compensation has changed just in the last couple of decades, and how resistant employers have been to responding sensibly.","As a share of gross domestic income, corporate profits have nearly doubled, to 6.4% in 2016 from 3.3% in 1990, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Meanwhile, the labor share, measured as wages and salaries paid to individuals, has been on a schneid, falling to 42.2% in 2013 from 46.2% in 1991. The labor share has since crept up to 43% as of 2016, but it’s still well below its postwar peak of 51.5%, reached in 1970.","As a reflection, if not a cause, of this trend, wages have been stagnant since the early 1980s. Hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, have been mired at about 80% of their level in 1960. They soared to more than double their 1960 level in the mid-1970s, then fell sharply during the recession of the early 1980s and never recovered. To the extent there has been job growth, it has been at the lower end of the income scale, in part because wage scales for what once were middle-class or lower-middle-income jobs have been downsized.","It may be no coincidence that the shift of income toward shareholders and away from labor followed by only a few years conservative economist Milton Friedman’s declaration of “shareholder value” as the guiding philosophy of corporate management. Friedman took his stance in a New York Times article in 1970. At first, business leaders disdained this view as too narrow.","But it didn’t take long for CEOs to divine the wisdom of a viewpoint that hit them where they lived, in their wallets. The harvest has been decades of increasing income and wealth inequality.","Today’s lament about the dearth of employable workers is the reprise of an old tune; Cardiff Garcia of the Financial Times collected a few old cover versions, which seem to get released to the airwaves on almost an annual basis. The tune never changes, but the dime never seems to drop for corporate leaders."
"Joe Setyon|Sep. 20, 2018 4:35 pm","Bergen County Sheriff's OfficeA New Jersey sheriff is under fire for a recording in which he is reportedly heard making racially charged comments about black people and marijuana. He also allegedly claimed the state's Sikh attorney general was appointed only due to his ""turban"" and speculated about the sexual orientation of New Jersey's unmarried lieutenant governor.","Details of the recording, which was obtained yesterday by the public radio station WNYC, were made public as New Jersey gets closer to legalizing marijuana for recreational use. Gov. Phil Murphy (D), who took office in January, promised during his campaign to legalize weed, and the state legislature generally seems to support the idea, as Reason's Eric Boehm reported last month.","Not all elected officials in the state agree. After Murphy was sworn in on January 16, Bergen County Sheriff Michael Saudino reportedly disparaged the new governor's inauguration speech. Speaking with colleagues in a county office building, he took issue with Murphy's views on criminal justice reform. According to WNYC, Saudino said:","[Murphy] talked about the whole thing, the marijuana, sanctuary state...better criminal justice reform. Christ almighty, in other words let the blacks come in, do whatever the fuck they want, smoke their marijuana, do this, do that, and don't worry about it. You know, we'll tie the hands of cops.","It didn't stop there. Saudino then took aim at New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, a Sikh, saying Murphy appointed him only because of ""the turban,"" WNYC reports.","The station says Saudino also asked about Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver's sexual orientation. ""Is she gay? Because she's never been married,"" Saudino reportedly said.","Saudino, a Democrat, is in his third term as Bergen County sheriff. His office did not return Reason's request for comment in time for publication.","In a statement, Murphy denounced Saudino's reported remarks. ""Anyone using racist, homophobic and hateful language is unfit for public office,"" he said, adding that Saudino ""must resign"" if the voice in the recording is his.","Saudino's alleged comments linking African Americans to marijuana aren't even accurate. The Washington Post reported in 2013 that black and white people consume marijuana at about the same rate, although black people are far more likely to be arrested for doing so. That's why, as Reason's Jacob Sullum has noted, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) supports legalizing marijuana at the federal level.","This is not the first time in recent months that a New Jersey elected official has been accused of making an outlandish claim about weed. In July, state Sen. Ron Rice (D–Newark) expressed concern that if weed is legalized, dispensaries will sell ""sex toy oils with marijuana.""",Photo Credit: Bergen County Sheriff's Office,Joe Setyon is an assistant editor at Reason.,Joe Setyon is an assistant editor at Reason.,"

												",It’s Cops 101.,The principal of East Side Community HS invited the New York Civil Liberties Union to give a two-day training session last week on interacting with police.,The 450 kids were coached on staying calm during NYPD encounters and given a “What To Do If You’re Stopped By The Police” pamphlet.,"NYCLU representatives told kids to be polite and to keep their hands out of their pockets. But they also told students they don’t have to show ID or consent to searches, that it’s best to remain silent, and how to file a complaint against an officer.","Principal Mark Federman said he brought in the NYCLU because students told teachers they had bad experiences with being stopped by police. He said the training also was relevant to history classes studying the Ferguson, Mo., shooting.","“We’re not going to candy-coat things — we have a problem in our city that’s affecting young men of color and all of our students,” Federman told The Post.","“It’s not about the police being bad,” he added. “This isn’t anti-police as much as it’s pro-young people . . . It’s about what to do when kids are put in a position where they feel powerless and uncomfortable.”",The hourlong workshops — held in small classroom sessions during advisory periods — focused on the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program and how to exercise Fourth Amendment rights when being stopped and questioned in a car or at home.,But some law enforcement experts say the NYCLU is going beyond civics lessons and doling out criminal-defense advice.,"Eugene O’Donnell, a former police officer and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the literature implies cops are “public enemy No. 1.”","“It’s unlikely that a high school student would come away with any other conclusion than the police are a fearful group to be avoided at all costs,” he said.","Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said, “Education is the key, but are Civil Liberties going in with an agenda or to educate? I think we deserve equal time and should have the opportunity to follow up with the same platform to explain exactly what police do and what we think is the best way to deal with the police.”","Senior Jason Zaragoza, 18, told The Post police stopped him three months ago after he left a party with friends.","“We said we were going home,” he said. “They said, ‘You’re lying to us — just tell us the truth.’ I was panicking, because I knew they could do anything to me and I can’t help myself.”
It’s not about the police being bad … this isn’t anti-police as much as it’s pro-young people. - Principal Mark Federman
Zaragoza said last week’s workshop “helped show me I can have my own defense against policemen who abuse their power.”",It’s not about the police being bad … this isn’t anti-police as much as it’s pro-young people.,"A 17-year-old student, who asked not to be named, said police once hassled him outside his apartment because he had a marker from art class in his pocket.","“If you don’t consent [to a search], sometimes they’ll still do it,” the senior said. “But [NYCLU reps] said do not resist.”","Candis Tolliver, NYCLU’s associate director for advocacy, said she visits classes after getting requests by teachers. This was the first time she trained an entire high school.","“This is not about teaching kids how to get away with a crime or being disrespectful,” Tolliver said. “This is about making sure both sides are walking away from the situation safe and in control.”","

","Imagine if I were to tell you there is a large group of government employees, with generous salaries and ridiculously cushy retirement pensions covered by the taxpayer, who enjoy incredible job security and are rarely held accountable even for activities that would almost certainly earn the rest of us prison time. When there is proven misconduct, these government employees are merely reassigned and are rarely dismissed. The bill for any legal settlements concerning their errors? It, too, is covered by the taxpayers. Their unions are among the strongest in the country.","No, I’m not talking about public-school teachers.",I’m talking about the police.,"We conservatives recoil at the former; yet routinely defend the latter — even though, unlike teachers, police officers enjoy an utter monopoly on force and can ruin — or end — one’s life in a millisecond.","For decades, conservatives have served as stalwart defenders of police forces. There have been many good reasons for this, including long memories of the post-countercultural crime wave that devastated, and in some cases destroyed, many American cities; conservatives’ penchant for law and order; and Americans’ widely shared disdain for the cops’ usual opponents. (“Dirty hippies being arrested? Good!” is not an uncommon sentiment.) Although tough-on-crime appeals have never been limited to conservative politicians or voters, conservatives instinctively (and, it turned out, correctly) understood that the way to reduce crime is to have more cops making more arrests, not more sociologists identifying more root causes. Conservatives are rightly proud to have supported police officers doing their jobs at times when progressives were on the other side.",But it’s time for conservatives’ unconditional love affair with the police to end.,"Let’s get the obligatory disclaimer out of the way: Yes, many police officers do heroic works and, yes, many are upstanding individuals who serve the community bravely and capably.",But respecting good police work means being willing to speak out against civil-liberties-breaking thugs who shrug their shoulders after brutalizing citizens.,"On Thursday in Staten Island, an asthmatic 43-year-old father of six, Eric Garner, died after a group of policemen descended on him, placing him in a chokehold while attempting to arrest him for allegedly selling cigarettes. A bystander managed to capture video in which Garner clearly cries out, “I can’t breathe!” Even after releasing the chokehold (chokeholds, incidentally, are prohibited by NYPD protocol), the same officer then proceeds to shove and hold Garner’s face against the ground, applying his body weight and pressure on Garner, ignoring Garner’s pleas that he cannot breathe. Worse yet, new video shows at least eight officers standing around Garner’s lifeless, unconscious body.",Who can defend this?,"And police-department Internal Affairs divisions are nearly as concerning as the cops themselves. Last week, a Miami police officer witnessed a car driving at high speeds in a pedestrian area. When he pulled the car over, the indignant driver stormed out. “Don’t you know the [expletive] I am?” the driver barked. It turns out that the driver was a police lieutenant within . . . Internal Affairs. The department in charge of ensuring proper police behavior consists of gents like this, whose first response is to assume that cops, like members of Congress, are above the law. What happened to the lieutenant? He has been transferred to “Special Investigations,” which, as a local NBC reporter points out, is more a promotion than a punishment.","#page#Police wrongly entering private property with no right to do so and causing death? Check! Last month, an officer in Utah, while searching for a three-year-old reported missing by his family (he was later found hiding in his own home’s basement), took it upon himself to enter the private backyard of a neighborhood home without a warrant — in clear violation of the homeowner’s Fourth Amendment rights (officers are only allowed to chuck the warrant requirement if a crime is occurring where time is of the essence). The officer — who had about as much courage as I did in gym class — was approached by the homeowner’s dog and, rather than retreat or fire at the dog’s leg, shot the dog point-blank in the head. The reaction of the Salt Lake City Police Department was to defend the officer, claiming he had a right to shoot as he was in fear for his life, and made no mention of why the officer entered private property without a warrant in the first place. Anyone who believes in upholding the Constitution should be outraged. Next time, it can just as easily be a young boy who points a toy gun at an officer, a confused elderly person, or even you.","Last month in Georgia, a SWAT team’s flash grenade landed in a baby boy’s crib. Worth noting: It was even the wrong house.","In the past six months, in my own humble neighborhood, I have witnessed officers try to enter a home without a warrant, hoping the residents were none the wiser about their rights; forcibly evict an elderly man from his apartment without an eviction order; threaten to arrest a driver who turned onto a street where the officer had neglected to place the “Street Closed” sign; and throw two teenage kids facedown on the ground for riding their bikes on the street at night.","This is to say nothing of the alarming level of increased hyper-militarization of our police forces, as covered in journalist Radley Balko’s Rise of the Warrior Cop. National Review’s John Fund and Charles Cooke have also written on the topic on this site. Small towns with SWAT teams and tanks? The beacon of freedom in the world is quickly becoming a police state, and no one seems to be paying much attention.","There is room for optimism, however — the Right is waking up to this reality, thanks in large part to two factors. The Tea Party’s emphasis on constitutionalism has refocused attention on the Bill of Rights. And probably more important, cell-phone cameras are having a tremendous impact — not only in holding officers accountable but in helping to raise awareness of the overall problem. It’s easy to dismiss eyewitness claims of police brutality, but a lot harder to ignore evidence such as a video of a man suffocating to death.","The new video and photo evidence invites the troubling thought that this kind of behavior has long been routine. Only now is it coming to the attention of people who have led lives insulated from heavy interaction with the police. There is some statistical reason to believe that police today may actually be better-disciplined than they were in the past, and there’s certainly reason to hope that dashboard cams, wearable audio and video devices, and other technologies will lead to better outcomes for law-abiding cops as well as for law-abiding civilians.","But that won’t happen unless citizens hold the cops at least as accountable as the government holds private citizens. So, police, it’s been a nice love affair, but right now we need some space. Time to put you in the friend zone. Please don’t call — and, just in case, we’ll keep that video recording of our last encounter.",— A. J. Delgado is a conservative writer and lawyer.

Cleveland Weather Summary: 52 degrees,1 Closing Alert,"A Euclid police officer who allegedly pulled out his gun during an off-duty bar fight back in August has been fired, with the mayor saying she ""no longer [has] confidence that you can perform successfully as a member of the Euclid Police Department.""","On Aug. 24, 32-year-old Officer Todd Gauntner and two members of the ""Hells Angels"" organization were involved in an altercation on the patio of Frank and Tony's Place on Second Street in Willoughby. Gauntner was apparently one of the aggressors, and investigators say he brandished his weapon and pointed it at the two men before a physical fight occurred that had to be broken up by bar patrons.","Gauntner was arrested and charged with using a weapon while intoxicated, and his case remains open in Willoughby Municipal Court. He was also suspended from his job for 15 days with pay while the department's internal affairs division investigated the incident.","According to a letter sent to Gauntner by Mayor Kristen Holzheimer Gail, Police Chief Scott Meyer recommended to her back on Sept. 11 that Gauntner be terminated from the force. A hearing was held two days later to consider all explanations regarding the altercation, but in the end it was agreed that Gauntner should be let go.","Mayor Gail, in the letter, chastised Gauntner for inviting trouble by making ""disparaging comments"" to the bikers and for not removing himself from the situation, adding he nearly lost his gun in the disturbance and ""put yourself and many bar patrols at a significant risk of substantial harm due to your reckless behavior.","""Your actions have brought discredit to you as a member of the Euclid Police Department,"" she wrote.",Gauntner's termination took effect Sept. 17.

Phily.COM has reported the case of Christos Sourovelis and Doila Welch,who were both caught up in having their homes seized to pay police pensions when the police arrested a relative they claimed was dealing drugs on their properties. Today, you basically have to shun relatives and never pick up a hick-hiker in trouble for if they have any drugs, even marijuana, there goes your assets.","The prosecutors, only after these people has money for lawyers and the press got involved, moved for dismissal in Common Pleas Court. The prosecutor agreed to drop the cases against properties as long as both owners took “reasonable measures” to ensure no further drug crimes occurred there.","Here is the entire problem. Only the rich can win for it is your burden to fork-over huge legal fees. If you do not have the money for lawyers, there goes your property. This is what is desperately wrong in America.

It would then become your burden to say – NO. That is uncivilized.","There is ABSOLUTELY nothing as it now stands for them to pass such a law. It is then the public’s burden to say no way and fight. This is seriously wrong within out legal system. This allows police to kill people randomly or to pull every person over on their way to work to see if they have all their identification. Whatever they do is OK because they do not FIRST have to go to some constitutional court and ask – is this law justified? Consequently, only the rich can defend the constitution. All others can pray – that’s about it.","This is the final stage of the collapse of the Roman Empire. When the state runs out of money, it historically attacks the people. In Rome, whole armies began sacking their own cities to get paid. The police are doing just that. Whatever they can confiscate goes to funding their own pensions.

 immunity, middle finger, police, traffic stop
",Permalink.Short link.,"Expressing your displeasure with law enforcement via hand gestures is not an arrestable offense. It can't even justify a traffic stop. Officers are learning this, one federal case at a time.
","Tim Geigner covered a case five years ago involving a cop, a veteran, and the veteran's upraised middle finger. It was expressive conduct the cop manning the speed trap found worthy of a traffic stop. A federal court disagreed, finding the officer's stated reason for conducting a traffic stop laughable.
","Perhaps there is a police officer somewhere who would interpret an automobile passenger's giving him the finger as a signal of distress, creating a suspicion that something occurring in the automobile warranted investigation. And perhaps that interpretation is what prompted Insogna to act, as he claims. But the nearly universal recognition that this gesture is an insult deprives such an interpretation of reasonableness. This ancient gesture of insult is not the basis for a reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation or impending criminal activity. Surely no passenger planning some wrongful conduct toward another occupant of an automobile would call attention to himself by giving the finger to a police officer.
","Yes, the officer actually claimed the bird is a universal distress signal and initiated the stop only because he believed Swartz was trying to flag down help for his wife, who was driving the vehicle.
","Let the deja vu commence. (via The Newspaper)
","Plaintiff and his sister, Beth Richardson, left the courthouse in her car. (Brian Clark Aff. ¶ 6, May 30, 2018 [ECF No. 48-1].) As they were leaving, Plaintiff saw several deputies “rush” to their patrol cars. (Id.) While riding in the car with Richardson a short time later, Coleman effectuated a traffic stop on her car. According to Coleman, he saw Plaintiff make a “gesture” that “concerned” him, so he pulled the car over. (Robert Coleman Decl. ¶ 7, May 14, 2018 [ECF No. 40-3].) Plaintiff categorically denies that he made any obscene, inappropriate, or concerning gesture to Coleman or anyone else. (Clark Decl. ¶¶ 12–13.)
","According to Plaintiff, after stopping the vehicle, Coleman approached the passenger side of the car; no officer approached the driver. (Id. ¶¶ 14, 17.) Coleman asked for Plaintiff’s identification, which Plaintiff provided, and Coleman asked Plaintiff why he “had ‘gigged’ him (or why [Clark] had given [Coleman] the finger).” (Id. ¶ 15.) Coleman returned to his car and, for twenty minutes, Clark and Richardson were detained. (Id. ¶ 19.)
","The federal judge finds Coleman's defense of his actions similarly comical. The decision [PDF] contains this incisive footnote:
","Although I am more or less constrained to reject his version of events for the purposes of this Motion, Coleman asserts, in conclusory fashion, that the stop of Clark was “lawful,” and that, in his experience, “people do not wave inappropriate or obscene gestures to a law enforcement officer unless something is wrong.” (Coleman Decl. ¶ 7.) Tellingly, he does not allege that he ever asked Clark if he was safe or that he inquired anything of the driver, nor does he assert any other interaction throughout his entire career where an “obscene” gesture was displayed towards him in an effort to indicate duress or request police assistance.
","So, it's a case exactly on point, even if the court doesn't have to reference the Swartz case to deny Coleman's requested immunity.
","If Plaintiff did not “gig” Coleman, then there is no question that the right to be free from a traffic stop without probable cause was clearly established at the time Coleman stopped Plaintiff and his sister. There is no dispute that the authority to detain citizens, conferred on deputy sheriffs, does not include the power to harass and intimidate those with whom one disagrees. See Trulock v. Freeh, 275 F.3d 391, 405 n.10 (4th Cir. 2001) (noting that “police officers . . . may not exercise their authority for personal motives, particularly in response to real or perceived slights to their dignity”). Under that factual scenario, Coleman is not entitled to qualified immunity. But even if Plaintiff did “gig” Coleman, I believe the law clearly establishes that a traffic stop under those circumstances would not comport with the First or Fourth Amendments.
","On top of that, there's another case directly on point that can be used to hold Coleman liable for his retaliatory traffic stop.
","It is rare to have the exact factual scenario an officer faced to have been clearly ruled on before, but Duran has remarkably similar facts and a defendant who went further than simply “gigging” a police officer. Although not a case from this circuit, Duran was decided nearly twenty years ago and accurately states the law.
","From Duran:
","The Court concluded that, “[i]narticulate and crude as Duran’s conduct may have been, it represented an expression of disapproval toward a police officer with whom he had just had a run-on. As such, it fell squarely within the protective umbrella of the First Amendment and any action to punish or deter such speech—such as stopping or hassling the speaker—is categorically prohibited by the Constitution.” [emphasis in the original]
","The plaintiff, Brian Clark, maintained he didn't flip off the officer, so that eliminates his First Amendment claim. If Clark did not engage in one-fingered expressive conduct (as he denies doing), there's no First Amendment activity prompting retaliation. However, the Fourth Amendment remains alive, if currently covered by the clumsy, authoritarian footprints of Lt. Coleman, who is now completely stripped of his immunity shield.
","Cops see a lot of animosity from citizens. But it's just part of the job. It may be unpleasant but it's not an arrestable offense, much less reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop. With rare exceptions, courts have sided with citizens and their expressive conduct. And they should continue to do so, because that's what separates the US from the world's authoritarian governments. This is also from the Duran decision, which is quoted directly in this case:
","The freedom of individuals to oppose or challenge police action verbally without thereby risking arrest is one important characteristic by which we distinguish ourselves from a police state. Thus, while police, no less than anyone else, may resent having obscene words or gestures directed at them, they may not exercise the awesome power at their disposal to punish individuals for conduct that is not merely lawful, but protected by the First Amendment.
","If a citizen lets the bird fly, officers should either let it ride or immediately seek legal representation. The courts say expressions of displeasure towards our government are the reason the First Amendment exists. Any cop who thinks an obscene gesture justifies a traffic stop is in the wrong business. Or the wrong country.

In May of 2017, a random sample of 1,207 adults from across the United States were asked their level of fear about eighty different fears across a huge variety of topics ranging from crime, the government, the environment, disasters, personal anxieties, technology and many others.",," Below is a list of the 10 fears for which the highest percentage of Americans reported being “Afraid,” or “Very Afraid.”","The 2017 list of fears clearly reflects political unrest and uncertainty in the wake of Donald Trump’s election as president. Increased tensions with North Korea, concerns about sweeping changes proposed to health care and discussion (at the time the survey was administered) of the United States leaving the Paris Climate Accords produced a much different list from 2016:","What is, perhaps, most striking about American fear in 2017 is that environmental fears, including water pollution and drinking water quality, figure more prominently than ever before. Environmental issues never cracked the top ten fears in our previous surveys.","In 2017, there was a sharp increase in environmental fears, likely due to fears about policy changes in Washington. The Trump Administration has charted a drastically different path; ordering the US Environmental Protection Agency not to enforce major pollution laws, and firing the EPA’s entire Science Advisory Board. ",Water Pollution ,"One of Donald Trump’s first actions as president was to withdraw the EPA’s “Waters of the United States” rule. This action drastically reduced the number of rivers and streams that could be protected from agricultural runoff under the Clean Water Act. Another of the administration’s first actions was to withdraw the “Stream Buffer” rule, which had been enacted to protect Appalachian rivers and streams from strip mining.",Drinking Water Quality,"The prominence of these fears is consistent with years of public opinion polling which shows that water pollution typically outranks other environmental problems in the mind of the public. Water pollution ranks third overall, followed closely by Drinking Water Quality.",Climate Change and Air Pollution ,"Public opinion polls show that climate change ranks lower than most other environmental issues as a source of public concern. This is likely due to the perception that the effects of the warming oceans and atmosphere are remote, far in the future, and more likely to affect “other people.”","The following is a complete, list of all eighty of the fears addressed by the Chapman University Survey of American Fears Wave 4 (2017), including the percent of Americans who reported being afraid or very afraid.", Sorted by Percent Afraid/Very Afraid , ,Sorted Alphabetically,*Data are unweighted,"For more information and articles, visit www.chapman.edu/fearsurvey.",Wilkinson College,America's Top Fears 2018 - Chapman University Survey of American Fears,"October 16, 2018",Paranormal America 2018 - Chapman University Survey of American Fears,"October 16, 2018",Fleeing Death: Disaster Evacuations in America - Chapman University Survey of American Fears,"October 16, 2018",Share on Twitter,Post to Facebook,3044 people shared or liked this.,"September 27, 2018 by Laura Silva  | News","The Department of Sociology hosts monthly colloquia featuring faculty members and guest scholars throughout the academic year.

"Jacob Sullum  | February 27, 2013","Imagine that a police officer, after taking it upon himself to
search someone's car, is asked to explain why he thought he would
find contraband there. ""A little birdie told me,"" he
replies. ",Joe Setyon|12.10.18,Jacob Sullum|12.07.18,Jacob Sullum|12.05.18,12.13.18 6:00 am,12.12.18 12:01 am,12.05.18 12:01 am,"Most judges would react with appropriate skepticism to such a
claim. But substitute ""a big dog"" for ""a little birdie,"" and you've
got probable cause. ","Or so says the U.S. Supreme Court, which last week unanimously

ruled that ""a court can presume"" a search is valid if police
say it was based on an alert by a dog trained to detect drugs. The
Court thereby encouraged judges to accept self-interested
proclamations about a canine's capabilities, reinforcing the
alarmingly common use of dogs to justify invasions of
privacy. ","Drug-detecting dogs are much less reliable than widely believed,
with 
false-positive error rates as high as 96 percent in the field.
A 2006 
Australian study found that the rate of unverified alerts by 17
police dogs used to sniff out drugs on people ranged from 44
percent to 93 percent. ","Police and prosecutors commonly argue that when a dog alerts and
no drugs are found ""the dog may not have made a mistake at all,"" as
Justice Elena Kagan put it, 
writing for the Court. Instead it ""may have detected substances
that were too well hidden or present in quantities too small for
the officer to locate."" ","This excuse is very convenient—and completely unfalsifiable.
Furthermore, probable cause is supposed to hinge on whether there
is a ""fair probability"" that a search will discover evidence of a
crime. The possibility that dogs will react to traces of drugs that
are no longer present makes them less reliable for that
purpose. ","So does the possibility that a dog will react to smell-alike
odors from legal substances, distractions such as food, or cues
from their handlers. Given all the potential sources of error, it
is hard to assess a dog's reliability without looking at its
real-world track record.","That is why the Florida Supreme Court, in the 
2011 decision that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned, said
police should provide information about a dog's hits and misses.
""The fact that the dog has been trained and certified,"" it said,
""is simply not enough to establish probable cause,"" especially
when, as in most states, there are no uniform standards for
training or certification. ","Kagan, by contrast, minimized the significance of a dog's
success at finding drugs in the field. She said police testing in
artificial conditions is a better measure of reliability, even
though handlers typically 
know where the drugs are hidden and can therefore direct the
animals to the right locations, either deliberately or
subconsciously. ","Instead of requiring police to demonstrate that a dog is
reliable, this decision puts the burden on the defense to show the
dog is not reliable through expert testimony and other
evidence that casts doubt on the training and testing methods used
by police. But experts are expensive, and police control all the
relevant evidence. ","Police even determine whether the evidence exists. Many
departments simply do not keep track of how often dog alerts lead
to unsuccessful searches, and this decision will only encourage
such incuriosity. ","The Court previously has said that police may 
use drug-sniffing dogs at will during routine traffic stops and
may 
search cars without a warrant, based on their own determination
of probable cause. Now that it has said a dog's alert by itself
suffices for probable cause, a cop with a dog has the practical
power to search the car of anyone who strikes him as
suspicious.","Even the question of whether a dog did in fact alert may be
impossible to resolve if there is no video record of the encounter,
which is often the case. As Florida defense attorney Jeff Weiner

puts it, the justices ""have given law enforcement a green light
to do away with the Fourth Amendment merely by uttering the magic
words, 'My dog alerted.'""",Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine and a nationally syndicated columnist.,Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine and a nationally syndicated columnist.,"

That's one of the points. NIST does not calibrate a dog's nose.

","Members of the NYPD’s elite Strategic Response Group — about 700 highly trained, heavily armed cops who respond to terrorism, mass protests and gun violence — say their bosses are demanding they write more “BS” tickets.","The pressure to meet secret “quotas” — a practice the NYPD denies — will diminish public safety, whistleblowers told The Post.","“We feel that we’re not as sharp on our tactics, because they are pulling us away from tactical training to grab numbers,” one said.","“Some officers don’t feel confident to go into active shooter situations anymore. It should be of great public concern, because we are the quick reaction force that’s going to neutralize and mitigate the threat from an active shooter. We can’t do that if the guns are off the street due to arrest processing.”","SRG officers who don’t meet ticket “quotas” — which bosses demand at roll call but don’t put in writing — are given undesirable shifts and denied overtime, several have complained to the Internal Affairs Bureau.","“The old school mentality of crushing cops who ‘don’t do enough’ is alive and well,” said one who filed a complaint.",The NYPD denied the accusations.,"“Quotas are strictly prohibited in the NYPD. The department does not and will not use quotas for enforcement activity in the Strategic Response Group or any other unit or assignment,” Sgt. Jessica McRorie said.","General training for SRG members has increased from four to six days a year, she added.",But officers said additional refresher training has been slashed.,"“If the officers aren’t confident in their training, they’ll be ineffective when the time comes for them to perform,” one said.","Each borough has an SRG squad, but the officers — who tote M4 assault rifles — respond to shootings, major crimes and hot spots citywide.","Members raced to the West Side Highway last Oct. 31, when a Uzbekistan immigrant rammed a rental truck onto a bike path, killing eight; to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital on July 2, 2017, when a disgruntled doctor shot seven people, killing a fellow physician before himself; and to Chelsea on Sept. 17, 2016, when a pressure-cooker bomb planted by an Afghani immigrant who supported ISIS exploded on West 23rd Street, injuring dozens.","Counter-terror assignments, large demonstrations, major crimes and missing children searches take up 90 percent of their work, with patrol in high-crime areas roughly 10 percent, SRG members say.","That leaves scant time to make arrests or write revenue-generating summonses for traffic infractions, public urination, open containers of alcohol, and other violations.","NYPD spokesperson Peter Donald disagreed: “SRG deploys to neighborhoods where crime still persists. The unit is expected to make those communities safer, by preventing crime and arresting those who commit violence.”","Under SRG Inspector John D’Adamo, the unit’s top cop, “the only thing that matters is [arrest and summons] activity,” an SRG cop charged.",D’Adamo has “brought in disciplinarians as commanding officers to dole out punishments to officers who don’t fall in line. He calls them his ‘cop crushers.’”,"Roy Richter, president of the NYPD Captains Endowment Association, disputed the claim. “There are no enforcement goals, and it is not a numbers-driven command,” he said.

				The city denies that there are quotas for cops —...							



","Last spring, Police Commissioner James O’Neill issued an in-house warning that supervisors caught enforcing quotas would face discipline.","“The bosses have realized this, and now don’t give a number,” the SRG member said. “They just punish cops until enough work is done to satisfy them.”","In one SRG command, a lieutenant “huddles us up after roll call and speaks really low at least two times per week,” an anonymous complaint to internal affairs states.","“He asked for one arrest and three summonses a month,” the complaint states, and warned of consequences for officers who “don’t bring in the numbers.”","Dozens of SRG officers have had their performance evaluations lowered for failure to comply, and many were transferred to worse shifts, an insider said.","“Everyone knows that to get promoted past the rank of captain, you have to impress the higher-ups,” the source said. “The easiest way to do that is to make your cops write and collar more than others.”","

","Nestled awkwardly among the usual guff, the outrage website Salon this week took a welcome flyer and accorded space to something genuinely alarming. “A SWAT team,” the headline screamed, “blew a hole in my 2-year-old son.” For once, this wasn’t hyperbole.","The piece’s author, Alecia Phonesavanh, described what it felt like to be on the business end of an attack that was launched in error by police who believed a drug dealer to be living and operating in her house. They “threw a flashbang grenade inside,” she reported. It “landed in my son’s crib.” Now, her son is “covered in burns” and has “a hole in his chest that exposes his ribs.” So badly injured was he by the raid that he was “placed into a medically induced coma.” “They searched for drugs,” Phonesavanh confirmed, but they “never found any.” Nor, for that matter, did they find the person they were looking for. He doesn’t live there. “All of this,” she asks, “to find a small amount of drugs?”","Historians looking back at this period in America’s development will consider it to be profoundly odd that at the exact moment when violent crime hit a 50-year low, the nation’s police departments began to gear up as if the country were expecting invasion — and, on occasion, to behave as if one were underway. The ACLU reported recently that SWAT teams in the United States conduct around 45,000 raids each year, only 7 percent of which have anything whatsoever to do with the hostage situations with which those teams were assembled to contend. Paramilitary operations, the ACLU concluded, are “happening in about 124 homes every day — or more likely every night” — and four in five of those are performed in order that authorities might “search homes, usually for drugs.” Such raids routinely involve “armored personnel carriers,” “military equipment like battering rams,” and “flashbang grenades.”","Were the military being used in such a manner, we would be rightly outraged. Why not here? Certainly this is not a legal matter. The principle of posse comitatus draws a valuable distinction between the national armed forces and parochial law enforcement, and one that all free people should greatly cherish. Still, it seems plain that the potential threat posed by a domestic standing army is not entirely blunted just because its units are controlled locally. To add the prefix “para” to a problem is not to make it go away, nor do legal distinctions change the nature of power. Over the past two decades, the federal government has happily sent weapons of war to local law enforcement, with nary a squeak from anyone involved with either political party. Are we comfortable with this?","The Right’s silence on the issue is vexing indeed, the admirable attempts of a few libertarians notwithstanding. Here, conservatives seem to be conflicted between their rightful predilection for law and order — an instinct that is based upon an accurate comprehension of human nature and an acknowledgment of the existence of evil — and a well-developed and wholly sensible fear of state power, predicated upon precisely the same thing. As of now, the former is rather dramatically winning out, leading conservatives to indulge — or at least tacitly to permit — excuses that they typically reject elsewhere. Much as the teachers’ unions invariably attempt to justify their “anything goes” contracts by pointing to the ends that they ostensibly serve (“Well you do want schools for the children or don’t you? Sign here”), the increasingly muscular behavior of local police departments is often shrugged off as a by-product of the need to fight crime. This, if left unchecked, is a recipe for precisely the sort of carte blanche that conservatives claim to fear.","Leaving aside the central moral question of the War on Drugs — which is whether the state should be responding to peaceful transactions and consensual behavior with violence — there is, it seems, considerable room between law enforcement’s turning a blind eye to the law and its aping the military in its attempt to uphold it. The cartels of Mexico and drug lords of America’s larger cities are one thing; but two-bit dealers and consumers of illicit substances are quite another. In the instance that Salon recorded, the person that authorities “were looking for, wasn’t there.” “He doesn’t even live in that house,” Phonesavanh confirmed. But suppose that he had, and that he’d been dealing drugs as charged? Does this alone make the case for the tactics? I suspect not. Instead, attempting to catch a violator in the act by releasing military vehicles full of machine-gun-wielding men, storming a home in the dead of night, and performing a no-knock raid that results in a two-year-old’s being pushed into a coma might, one suspects, be overkill — in many similar cases, literally so. The question for conservatives should be this: If cowboy poetry is no justification for federal intrusion, can drug dealing be said to serve as an open invitation for the deployment of the ersatz 101st?","In the more febrile of the Right’s quarters, the sight of MRAPs being delivered to the chief of police in Westington, Mont., has given rise to all forms of regrettable silliness — to visions of black helicopters and reeducation camps and an America on the verge of being taken by force by the gun-toting rangers of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Nevertheless, a small amount of latent paranoia has served America well, and Chekhov’s advice that “one must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it” should be applied to governments as rigorously as to aspiring playwrights. Once the holders of the monopoly on violence are accorded the latest weaponry, there will always be the temptation to use it. Likewise, once one has taken the mental and linguistic leap of ascribing to domestic law enforcement the imprimatur of “war,” one may be inclined to reach for the trigger that little bit more quickly. The disaster at Waco, Texas, was, it seems, more cock-up than conspiracy. But the recognition in the aftermath that the whole bloody mess could have been avoided if local officers had taken the time to chat with the victims should haunt us to this day. Rushing in at 100 miles per hour rarely works out, whatever the ill that one is attempting to resolve.","The Left’s current inclination is to spin offenses out of straw — having no major battles left to fight, it seeks to detect microaggressions; with overt bigotry so thin on the ground, the dog whistles have come out; and with the barriers to the Declaration’s maxim having been largely removed, the focus has shifted to the structural and the invisible. But first-degree burns and holes in the chest are different things altogether — not to be dismissed or downplayed — and that the issue is being raised by an outlet known for its absurdity should not dull its impact. Will the Right acknowledge the scale of the threat, applying its usual mistrust of power to a favored group, or will its usually alert advocates leave themselves willfully in the dark until, one day, a flashbang with their name on it is tossed through the window to wake them up with a start?",— Charles C. W. Cooke is a staff writer at National Review.,NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.,"

","Newly published documents show that the San Jose Police Department (SJPD), which publicly acknowledged Tuesday that it should have “done a better job of communicating” its drone acquisition, does not believe that it even needs federal authorization in order to fly a drone. The Federal Aviation Administration thinks otherwise.","Late last month, a set of documents showed that the SJPD acquired a Hexacopter called the Century Neo 660, along with a GoPro video camera and live video transmitter. The nearly $7,000 January 2014 purchase was funded through a grant from the Bay Area Urban Areas Security Initiative, a regional arm of the Department of Homeland Security. San Jose, which proclaims itself the “capital of Silicon Valley,” is the third-largest city in California and the tenth-largest in the United States.","The documents, which were sent to MuckRock as part of a public records request and were published on Wednesday for the first time, make a number of statements suggesting that the SJPD has a deep misunderstanding of current drone policy.","Further ReadingRare cop-owned drone in California could fly over Bay Area soonThe documents also show that SJPD Police Chief Larry Esquivel signed off on the drone acquisition on March 21, 2014, nearly two months after the drone was actually acquired. Esquivel specifically stated that his “approval/implementation” was contingent on a review by the San Jose City Attorney’s Office, a “policy in place—on specific guidelines for UAV,” referring to the drone, and “messaging/outreach to public,” none of which appear to have actually taken place. Ars has filed a new public records request to see if such a review by the City Attorney's Office ever took place.","A March 2014 e-mail from Western Division Commander James Randol to SJPD Deputy Chief David Hober states, ""The UAV is not a drone. Drones are regulated by the FAA. The FAA doesn’t regulate our device.”",But that’s not at all the perspective of the Federal Aviation Administration.,"“Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft—manned or unmanned—in US airspace needs some level of authorization from the FAA to ensure the safety of our skies,” Ian Gregor, an FAA spokesman for the Pacific Division, told Ars in a statement.","“The FAA authorizes UAS operations that are not for hobby or recreation on a case-by-case basis. Public entities (federal, state, and local governments, and public universities) may apply for a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA), which, when approved, provides authorization for [unmanned aircraft systems] operations in the [national airspace system],"" he said.",The SJPD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.,"Elsewhere in the Golden State, Ventura County (just north of Los Angeles County) filed for a COA approval from the FAA. Way back in 2006, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department tested drones before grounding its program. In 2007, the Sacramento Police Department said it was ""exploring"" drone use. Even a public utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, announced in July 2014 that it had received FAA approval for drone use in inspection of power transmission equipment.","“The newly disclosed documents raise serious questions about whether the police department did its homework before spending money on a drone that it cannot even legally use,” Catherine Crump, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told Ars. “But more broadly, it is worth asking why the federal government is dispensing taxpayer money to local police departments to purchase equipment that the FAA has so far largely banned out of concern for public safety.”","Further ReadingFAA can’t regulate small RC aircraft as “drones,” judge rulesHowever, experts in privacy and drone law note that taking such a position is not legally absurd.","“It seems like they just goofed and they didn't understand,” Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington, told Ars. “But it's not an unreasonable position to take. Legally speaking, there has been at least one other person who claimed that the FAA could not regulate drones in defining aircraft, which is what the FAA can regulate.”","Calo outlined the 2011 case of Raphael Pirker, who used a small drone to film above New York City as part of a TV commercial. The FAA wasn’t amused, and it fined Pirker $10,000, but he successfully challenged the fine in a case before the National Transportation Safety Board. That case will likely be appealed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, where Calo noted that he expects the FAA to prevail, as courts typically grant wide latitude to such agencies.","“This is currently a gray area because there is no specific regulation concerning unmanned aircraft systems,” said Brendan Schulman, a New York-based attorney who represents Pirker. “The FAA has previously relied upon a 2007 policy statement to assert that specific authorization is required for the use of a drone, but that policy was deemed nonbinding by the judge in the Pirker case which is currently on appeal. More recently, the FAA has interpreted a 2012 statute to the same end, but that interpretation appears to contradict the text and intent of the statute.”","But the SJPD has not explicitly stated that it is relying on a Pirker-style argument, nor that it wishes to challenge the FAA.","Curiously, the SJPD’s August 5 statement outlines numerous additional situations in which the drone would be used—providing far more scenarios than what its own officers discussed internally.","“SJPD intends to use the [unmanned aerial system, or UAS] primarily to access potential explosive devices and avoid exposing police bomb squad personnel to possible hazards,” said Albert Morales, a SJPD spokesman. “The UAS can be flown over a device to obtain images that would assist the bomb technicians. Another possible use would be for situations that threaten public safety. These could include dangers such as active shooters, hostage taking, or other such tactical situations where lives might be in immediate danger.”","However, a March 5, 2014 memo from SJPD Special Operations Commander Greg Albin to Chief of Police Larry Esquivel says that he recommends “the Bomb Squad’s usage of the Department’s UAV during bomb investigations when needed due to terrain obstructions to enhance officer and public safety.”","Then there are two complete redacted lines before Albin concludes, “The UAV would be an intelligence-gathering component and would be critical to the safe completion of both missions.”","Even state legislators have no idea what law enforcement agencies have drones or are attempting to acquire them, which is why some have pushed for a change in the state law.","A bill pending in the California State Senate would require public notice prior to a drone’s use. The bill also requires a warrant for the drone’s use, with some exceptions, including “imminent threat to life,"" traffic accidents, and the ability to “inspect state parks and wilderness areas for illegal vegetation,” which likely refers to unauthorized marijuana farms.","“That's part of the issue—with that part as well there is no rule in place about how it has to be reported,” Douglas Lorenz, a spokesman for the bill’s assembly author, told Ars. Lorenz's boss, Jeff Gorell, is a Republican state assemblyman representing Ventura County and is also a commander in the United States Navy Reserve.","“What San Jose did was perfectly legal,” Lorenz continued. “They don't have to have a public discussion. They don't have to tell anybody what they're buying right now. That's why we want to have clear state law that defines how they can do this.”","Nicole Ozer, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, concurred.","""The SJPD seems to definitely misunderstand some critical issues related to drones and to me that underscores why there should be a public debate so the right kind of information gets out,"" she told Ars.",You must login or create an account to comment.,Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.,"

"Zuri Davis|Jul. 11, 2018 4:30 pm","The press wants access to footage that might show what Broward County sheriff's deputies were doing during the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School earlier this year. Broward County officials would rather not give it to them. After a judge ruled in the media's favor, the school board and the state attorney appealed the ruling. Yesterday the Fourth District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach, Florida, heard oral arguments in the case.","The battle began when the sheriff confirmed that the school's resource officer, Scot Peterson, did not go inside of the school to confront the shooter. (Peterson eventually resigned from the department with a $8,702.35-a-month lifetime pension.) Then members of the Coral Springs Police Department claimed to CNN that three more sheriff's deputies remained outside the school and hidden behind their vehicles when they arrived on the scene. It was not clear whether the shooter was in fact still in the building when the officers arrived, but the Coral Springs cops were upset either way that the deputies did not join them inside the school.","Hoping to explain the deputies' behavior, several media organizations sued for the exterior footage. Officials resisted the request, claiming that releasing the footage could facilitate future attacks by revealing blind spots in the school's surveillance system.","Attorney Dana McElroy, representing the plaintiffs, points out that Broward Superintendent Robert Runcie has promised to improve school surveillance. So even if someone somewhere really is plotting a second attack, whatever info he might glean from the video would be outdated.","""The footage is the only objective evidence of what occurred and when,"" Barbara Petersen of the First Amendment Foundation, which has joined the media side of the lawsuit, tells the Miami Herald. ""The whole purpose of our open government laws is oversight and accountability. Access to the video footage allows us to hold those accountable who may not have done their jobs.""","Though the sheriff's office fought the initial lawsuit, it did not join the school board and the state attorney in the appeal. Spokesperson Veda Coleman-Wright has said the office has no objection to publicizing the footage.",Photo Credit: Daniel Varela/TNS/Newscom,Zuri Davis is assistant editor at Reason.,Zuri Davis is assistant editor at Reason.,"

"Standing on the front steps of First Congregational Church of Oakland late last month, Nichola Torbett issued a declaration.","“We can no longer tolerate the trauma inflicted on our communities by policing,” Torbett, a white church volunteer, said in front of churchgoers who held photos of African Americans shot dead by law enforcement. The church, she promised, would never call the cops again in nearly every circumstance. Dozens of members had agreed to do the same.","""How do police help? They often don't,"" Torbett later said in an interview. ""So, especially as white people, why call them?""","As videos of the aftermath of white Americans dialing 911 on African Americans for taking part in innocent activities have repeatedly gone viral — two black friends meeting at a Starbucks in Philadelphia, a black grad student napping in a Yale dormitory common room, a black family having a barbecue just blocks from the Oakland congregation — members of this small church are taking extreme measures in response.","They call it “divesting” from police. The church is part of a tiny but growing movement among liberal houses of worship around the nation making similar vows. They include another church in Oakland, one in San Jose and one in Iowa City, Iowa. It’s mostly white ministers and majority white congregations leading the efforts, which come as debates over racism, stereotypes and the role of law enforcement hit universities, businesses and neighborhood councils across the U.S.","At Colorado State University, administrators are grappling with an incident last month in which a white parent called police on two Native American students touring the campus. The woman told a 911 operator that the teens, who joined the tour late, were acting “really odd"" and wore dark clothes with ""weird symbolism.""","Waffle House has come under fire for recent videos in which police aggressively arrested black customers at restaurants in the South. In one North Carolina incident, a video showed a white officer slamming and choking a 22-year-old man who arrived after taking his sister to her prom. An employee had called police on the customer, alleging that he yelled at workers and tried to start a fight. Waffle House and police said they did no wrong.","The Starbucks incident, in which two men who had made no purchases were denied bathroom access before police were called, led to a new rule that bathrooms are open to noncustomers. Thousands of Starbucks stores shut down Tuesday afternoon while employees were trained in racial bias awareness.","At First Congregational, which is part of the United Church of Christ denomination, the decision to avoid police has generated a variety of responses. A regional body of the United Church of Christ in Northern California endorsed the effort. Elsewhere in the nation, churches have scoffed.","Conservative media have accused the Oakland church of being anti-police, and questioned its commitment to safety. (""All I got to say is ‘Oakland, California’ and immediately you know we are talking about nutcases,” one commentator said during a YouTube broadcast).","Some nearby houses of worship, including a Presbyterian church and a Reconstructionist Jewish synagogue, have asked how they could join. Locals, curious about the church’s announcement, have started to stop by on Sundays. On Facebook, dozens of people are signed up to attend a July workshop at the church. It’s called “How to NOT call the PoLice (Sheriffs & Kkkorts) Ever.”","“We’re taught to turn to police for so much, even simple disagreements between people,” said church member Sarah Pritchard, who is also white and is setting up trainings such as the July workshop. “Why can’t we resolve issues among ourselves?”","“We need to be there as a community for one another so we can provide safety for our congregation without police,” she said. Pritchard said the ban wouldn’t apply if there was a shooting or other life-threatening violence. But nearly everything else is fair game.","First Congregational began 158 years ago as a small house church and has been in its current location since 1923. As the Bay Area became a center of leftist social movements in the 1960s and 1970s, the church became known as one of the most politically active in the region. Today, a Black Lives Matter banner hangs from the church’s facade. Inside its sanctuary, black and white banners spell out “truth,” “freedom,” “justice” and “equality.” Its worship space features a memorial to black Americans who have died in police encounters or custody.","At most, a few dozen people usually show up for Sunday service. Members are largely lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer; about half are white. Its leaders are mostly women, many of whom work in nonprofits, social work and education. Because there’s no paid pastor, members take turns preaching and make all decisions collectively. It took around two years of planning before announcing the police ban.","The policy was first put on its website during Holy Week, when Christians recount the last days of Jesus’ life before his death and resurrection. “NO MORE STATE-SPONSORED CRUCIFIXIONS IN THE NAME OF ‘SAFETY,’” the posting said. The church likened today’s police to those who sentenced Christ to death.","Last month at Oakland’s Lake Merritt, a short distance from the church, a white woman complained to police about a black family using a charcoal barbecue in a no-charcoal area of the park. The event further fueled anger and disappointment among church members who believe some white people are too quick to turn to police when it concerns racial minorities. Police did not arrest anybody or issue citations. Many churchgoers feared it could have been worse.","“We recognize that Jesus was killed, not for anything he did, but for who he was, and we see the same happening to black and brown people today,” Torbett said. Still, “we’re still debating its limitations,” she added about the no-police agreement. Nothing has happened yet that would typically warrant a call to the cops.","Those questions about limitations came up recently after a Sunday church service. Church leaders sat in an office, discussing their nascent effort and hopes for the future.","Marcia Lovelace, a volunteer worship leader, spoke about training church staffers about what to do when people won’t leave the building.","The church, which sits on a small hill just north of downtown Oakland, frequently opens its doors to the homeless, mentally ill and those who struggle with drug addictions. It offers a food pantry, transit cards and a place to nap. But it draws the line at hosting people overnight.","“We once had a street person who needed mental health care and wouldn't leave,” Lovelace, who is 70 and white, said as she described an incident before the new policy. “Police were called and church members who fit the description were hassled by police. For those of us who have the skin color that keeps us from having those experiences, it made things real.”","According to current guidelines, church members would not call police if such a situation arose again. In lieu of police services, the church has secured a $10,000 grant to train its members and other community groups on de-escalation tactics and self-defense.","Carol Robison, another volunteer church leader, proposed an idea for dealing with burglaries. The buildings has no security, and thieves have taken purses and backpacks. Doors are unlocked during the day.","The building’s property insurance requires police reports for claims. But “we’d rather not attract more police,” said Robison, who is 62 and white. She suggested going “to the police station to file a report instead of having the police come into your neighborhood.”","The conversation turned to another aspect of policing: deterring and solving crime. Church leaders said they could prevent crime by forming better relationships with neighborhood residents. Their theory, put simply: Friends won’t steal from friends. But if crime still happened, church members prayed they could make peace between victims and perpetrators directly without police or courts.","Recently, the church received a phone call from Oakland police with a request to talk about its announcement. The group disagreed on how to respond, if at all.","“We are in conversation about getting into conversation with Oakland police,” Torbett said.","Soo Hyun Han, a Korean American who attends services with her black spouse and biracial son, said she hoped the church wouldn’t avoid talking to police completely.","“Hopefully that is a place where a real conversation would happen,” Han, 44, said of sitting down with officers.",The Police Department has not responded publicly to the church’s stance. A spokeswoman said Chief Anne E. Kirkpatrick was unavailable.,"But Barry Donelan, president of the Oakland police union, said he wasn’t bothered by the church.","“If this particular group doesn’t want to call the police, that’s their position, that’s their view,” Donelan said. “But my members are happy to respond to the tremendous need for police services elsewhere. If they take this view, it makes it so more police can be directed to those who ask for them.” He added that he would “never discourage people from calling police” if they changed their minds.","Donelan pointed out that officers in the city field thousands of calls a day. He said the majority don’t result in injuries, shootings or deaths. He scoffed at the church’s suggestion that police contribute to violence instead of helping resolve it.","“Many in the city would say there’s not enough of us,” he said. “These guys are here to serve the community as best they can.”"
"A. Barton Hinkle  | July 8, 2013",A cop shot a dog the other day. Again.,Scott Shackford|12.13.18,Joe Setyon|12.12.18,Joe Setyon|12.12.18,6.11.18 12:00 pm,6.06.18 12:00 pm,6.04.18 12:00 pm,"Maybe you’ve seen the video -- it was all over the Internet,
complete with the dog's grisly death
spasms. Hawthorne, Calif., resident Leon Rosby was using
his cellphone to record a standoff between police officers and
armed robbers. At the end of the standoff, officers headed Rosby’s
way. He put his dog, a Rottweiler named Max, in his car, then
placed his arms behind his back to be cuffed.  (He’d had
run-ins with the law before.) ","As the officers began taking Rosby into custody, Max jumped out
the car window and approached. At first he sniffed the ground and
paced, agitated but not threatening. When an officer made a move
toward Max, he jumped and snapped.",So the officer killed him.,"This was just a few days after police officers in
the Chicago suburb of South Holland went to the
house of Randy Green to investigate a report of an unleashed dog.
While the Green family slept inside, the officers watched their
dog, Grady, rest on the front porch. After 20 minutes, according to
the Greens’ lawsuit, “Grady approached Officer [Chad] Barden,” at
which point Barden – who, the lawsuit contends, had a dog pole in
his vehicle – shot him. ","That incident followed by just a few days another one, also
caught on video, in which two El Monte, Calif., officers
entered – without notice – the fenced yard of Chi Nguyen and shot
one of the family dogs when it approached. The San Gabriel Valley
Tribune reports “there were four children present at the home when
the shooting occurred, and a children’s pool party was taking place
in a front yard across the street, according to the family and the
video.” El Monte Police Department spokesman Dan Buehler said the
officer “followed policy.”",That’s precisely the problem.,"Across the country, both state laws and departmental policies
seem to let police officers use deadly force as a first resort
against family pets that often present little or no threat. In one
infamous 2010 case from Missouri, an officer shot and killed a
dog that had been subdued and held on a catch-pole. In another, an
officer shot D.C. resident Marietta Robinson’s 13-year-old dog,
Wrinkles, after Robinson had confined the dog to her bathroom.","Last year police officers chasing two suspects in Lake
Charles,Louisiana, shot a dog named Monkey that barked at them.
In Henrico,Va., last July, police officers went to the home of
a homicide victim to notify the family of the slaying. When the
family dog ran toward them, the officers shot and killed it.
In Danville four years ago, a police officer shot and
killed a 12-pound miniature dachshund. For growling at him.",Danville's chief says the officer followed policy.,"Police officers receive extensive training about the use of
force when it is applied against humans. But how many departments
provide training on dealing with pets? Very few, says the Humane
Society. This despite the fact that, according to a Justice
Department paper (“The Problem of Dog-Related Incidents and
Encounters”), 39 percent of U.S. homes have dogs. More
than half of dog owners “consider their dogs family members,” it
continues, “and another 45.1 percent view them as companions or
pets.” Less than 1.5 percent view them as property.","Do we really need systematic training to combat a few isolated
incidents, however unfortunate? The question rests on a false
premise. Civil-liberties writer Radley Balko notes that over a
nine-year period Milwaukee officers killed 434 dogs – about one
every eight days. And that’s just one city. Across the country,
according to Justice, “the majority of [police] shooting incidents
involve animals, most frequently dogs.”","But surely those shootings occur because the animals themselves
pose a serious threat, right? Nope. The Justice Department says not
only that “dogs are seldom dangerous” but that even when they are,
“the overwhelming majority of dog bites are minor, causing either
no injury at all or injuries so minor that no medical care is
required.” As Balko writes, “If dangerous dogs are so common, one
would expect to find frequent reports of vicious attacks on meter
readers, postal workers, firemen, and delivery workers. But
according to a spokesman from the United States Postal Service,
serious dog attacks on mail carriers are vanishingly
rare.” ","Yet serious – deadly – attacks against dogs are all too common.
They shouldn’t be. And the solutions are obvious: Departmental
policies, backed by state law, should require police officers to
use lethal force against companion animals only as a last resort.
Officers should receive training in safe and non-lethal methods of
animal control – and in dog behavior: “An approaching dog is almost
always friendly,” according to the Justice Department; “a dog who
feels threatened will usually try to keep his distance.”","Finally, lawmakers should require an investigation of every dog
shooting, to avoid what the public too often gets now: a knee-jerk
defense of the officer involved and a callous dismissal of the
family’s suffering.","After all, if a child ran at a policeman with a knife the
officer might fire in self-defense – yet nobody would just let it
go at that. Animals don’t occupy the same moral station as
children, but family pets are more than just property. A badge and
a gun should not be a license to shoot them at whim.","This column

"Hillary Clinton has claimed from the very beginning of the email scandal that nothing she sent or received was marked classified at the time. As recently as Wednesday of this week, she told Fox News' Bret Baier that ""nothing that I sent or received was marked classified. And nothing has been demonstrated to contradict that. So it is the fact. It was the fact when I first said it. It is the fact that I’m saying it now.""","Unfortunately for Hillary, the State Department today released an email from 2012 that totally contradicts her ""fact."" According to Catherine Herridge at Fox News, the email carries ""a classified code known as a 'portion marking' - and that marking was on the email when it was sent directly to Clinton’s account."" (Not retroactively, as the Clinton camp likes to claim.)","The “C” - which means it was marked classified at the confidential level - is in the left-hand-margin and relates to an April 2012 phone call with Malawi's first female president, Joyce Banda, who took power after the death of President Mutharika in 2012.","""(C) Purpose of Call: to offer condolences on the passing of President Mukharika and congratulate President Banda on her recent swearing in.""",Everything after that was fully redacted before it was publicly released by the State Department -- a sign that the information was classified at the time and dealt with sensitive government deliberations.,"A US government source said there are other Clinton emails with classified markings, or marked classified, beyond the April 2012 document.","A January 2014 federal government training manual, called ""Marking Classified National Security Information,"" provides a step-by-step guide for reviewing classified information, and allocating classified codes or ""portion markings.""","""This system requires that standard markings be applied to classified information...Markings shall be uniformly and conspicuously applied to leave no doubt about the classified status of the information, the level of protection required, and the duration of classification.""","It adds, ""A portion is ordinarily defined as a paragraph, but also includes subjects, titles, graphics, tables, charts, bullet statements, sub-paragraphs, classified signature blocks, bullets and other portions within slide presentations, and the like.""","""Portion markings consist of the letters “(U)” for Unclassified, “(C)” for Confidential, “(S)” for Secret, and “(TS)” for Top Secret.""","As has been pointed out too many times to count, whether an email is marked ""classified"" or not  is completely irrelevant because it was her responsibility to ascertain whether the information shared through her private email server was classified. But Hillary kept using the excuse and will probably continue to do so because it's all she's got.","

December 8, 2018 5:00 am","New Jersey law enforcement officials refused to say on Thursday how they planned to go about enforcing the state's ban on the possession of any magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, which goes into effect on Monday.",Neither the state police nor the attorney general's office elaborated on how they plan to enforce the law. Nor did they provide any guidance for those currently in possession of the magazines.,"The law, signed by Gov. Phil Murphy in June along with five other new gun laws, gave New Jersey gun owners who currently possess the magazines in question 180 days to either surrender them, permanently modify them to only accept up to 10 rounds, or transfer them to somebody who is allowed to legally own them. The deadline is set to expire on Monday.","A lawsuit brought by the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs and supported by the National Rifle Association failed on Thursday as the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals declared the confiscation law constitutional. Any civilian caught in possession of a magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds may be arrested and prosecuted. Possession of such magazines after the deadline will be considered a crime of the fourth degree under state law and carry up to 18 months in prison and up to $10,000 in fines or both.",Nearly all modern full-size or compact handguns and rifles sold in the United States come standard with magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.,State police told the Washington Free Beacon the effort to enforce the law will be a statewide endeavor directed by the attorney general's office. They would not comment other than to say they will enforce New Jersey's laws.,"""We will enforce the law of the state,"" Lieutenant Theodore Schafer of the New Jersey State Police said. ""That's our plan.""",Schafer would not give any details on the agency's plan to enforce the law and referred the Free Beacon to the attorney general's office for further questions.,"Leland Moore, a public information officer for the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, refused to answer any questions on how the state planned to deal with gun owners who did not comply with the new law. He would not say if the attorney general has any guidance at all for those who currently own the magazines being targeted, which gun-rights activists have estimated to be up to a million New Jersey residents, or provide any insight about how the state will deal with those who don’t turn in, modify, or destroy their magazines.","""We have no comment,"" Moore said to multiple inquiries.","When pressed about whether everyone in possession of such magazines would be arrested and prosecuted, he refused to comment. When asked if officers might be sent ""door to door"" as some critics fear about such confiscation efforts, he refused to comment.","""We've answered your query,"" Moore said. ""We have no comment.""","The law does not appear to provide any funding or direction for any sort of additional enforcement efforts beyond normal police activity. There have been no reports of additional mobilization of police forces or any instructions to patrol for the magazines in question. Still, the attorney general's office would not say what tactics or efforts would be used in carrying out the law.","In a 2-1 vote, the 3rd Circuit ruled the magazine confiscation law could go into effect because it does not violate either the Second, Fifth, or 14th Amendment as plaintiffs had claimed.","Judge Patty Shwartz, an Obama appointee, wrote for the majority that the law serves a legitimate public safety purpose.","""Today we address whether one of New Jersey's responses to the rise in active and mass shooting incidents in the United States—a law that limits the amount of ammunition that may be held in a single firearm magazine to no more than ten rounds—violates the Second Amendment, the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause,"" she wrote. ""We conclude that it does not. New Jersey's law reasonably fits the State's interest in public safety and does not unconstitutionally burden the Second Amendment's right to self-defense in the home. The law also does not violate the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause because it does not require gun owners to surrender their magazines but instead allows them to retain modified magazines or register firearms that have magazines that cannot be modified. Finally, because retired law enforcement officers have training and experience that makes them different from ordinary citizens, the law's exemption that permits them to possess magazines that can hold more than ten rounds does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.""","Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, dissented by saying the state did not meet the burden of proving they haven't violated the Second Amendment.","""The Second Amendment is an equal part of the Bill of Rights,"" he wrote. ""And the Supreme Court has repeatedly told us not to treat it differently. So, we must apply strict scrutiny to protect people's core right to defend themselves and their families in their homes. That means holding the government to a demanding burden of proof. Here, the government has offered no concrete evidence that magazine restrictions have saved or will save potential victims. Nor has it made any showing of tailoring.""","Gurbir Grewal, New Jersey's attorney general, tweeted on Thursday that the decision is a ""big win for public safety and law enforcement safety"" and upheld ""a sensible law to address mass shootings.""","The case, however, may not be settled. The Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs promised on Thursday to appeal the decision.","""This decision is plainly wrong and upholds New Jersey's unconstitutional law turning one million honest citizens into felons for keeping property obtained legally that could be used for defending their lives,"" Scott Bach, head of the gun-rights group, told the Hill.

"Elizabeth Nolan Brown|Feb. 9, 2018 4:52 pm",screenshot from SeventhTerrace.comKristen Hyman has been fired from her job as a New Jersey police officer for having appeared in bondage and erotica films years ago.,"The 31-year-old was first suspended from the Hudson County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) last spring, just a few days before her police academy graduation, when her past as a dominatrix and fetish-film actress came to light.",Hyman has said she did not appear nude or engage in sexual intercourse in these films. Her appearances involved things like smoking cigarettes and kicking (consenting) men in the balls.,"Although there was nothing illegal about her past gigs, Hyman's superiors said she should have revealed them on her police-academy application. For a question about past work, Hyman said she had been an actress and model. Apparently this was not specific enough.","Hyman was suspended for six days before an administrative judge rescinded her suspension. She was sworn in as a Hudson County sheriff's deputy on June 8, 2017. But immediately thereafter, Hyman was placed on paid administrative leave pending further internal investigation of her work history.","On Wednesday, an administrative hearing officer made the decision to fire Hyman. Hudson County Sheriff Frank Schillari told The Jersey Journal he agreed with the decision.","But while Hyman's history of legal work is a firable offense to the sheriff, deputies engaging in illegal conduct like drunk driving and vehicular assault has not been deemed sufficient grounds for firing by Schillari in the past.","In 2005, for instance, sheriff's officer Aleisha Cruz was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol after repeatedly ramming her SUV into a date's car and then hitting the man directly once he exited the vehicle (he was not seriously injured). Cruz plead guilty and was offered placement in a pre-trial diversion program rather than jail time.","After her arrest, Cruz was placed on modified duty at work and forbidden from carrying a gun. But she continued to be employed as a Hudson County sheriff's deputy for at least three and a half more years—until a second drunk-driving arrest in 2009.","Hyman has claimed that the real reason for her firing was not her previous dominatrix work but the fact that she rebuffed the advances of HCSO attorney Robert Pompliano, 70, while she was in the police academy. ""Mr. Pompliano made a sexual advance against [Hyman], touched her, kissed her, and she rebuffed him,"" wrote her lawyer, Doug Anton, in a letter to the administrative hearing officer overseeing the case. ""For that he has jumped all over this opportunity to get her fired."" Hyman has alleged that the push for Sheriff Schillari to fire her came from Pompliano.",Photo Credit: Screenshot from Domina Nyx Blake video on SeventhTerrace.com ,Elizabeth Nolan Brown is an associate editor at Reason magazine.,Elizabeth Nolan Brown is an associate editor at Reason magazine.,"

"createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');Two Utah Police shot and killed Danielle Willard, 21, outside an apartment complex on Nov. 2, 2011.                                             Facebook/Justice for Danielle                                     The parents of a 21-year-old woman who was shot in the back of the head by two Utah police officers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit. "," West Valley, Utah police have said they thought  Danielle Willard was buying drugs when they killed her in an apartment complex, the Salt Lake City Tribune has reported. "," She tried to back her car into them when they approached her, police say. "," The suit claims she was ""shot in the back of the head, assassination style"" and that it was ""without justification"" and ""unrelated to any legitimate law enforcement purpose."" "," The death of Willard set off a public firestorm over the West Valley, Utah's narcotics department. The FBI began investigating the department, as did the city itself,  The New York Times reported. West Valley officials found that in some cases officers on the narcotics squad mishandled evidence. "," Willard, who struggled with heroin addiction, had gone to Utah for rehab, her mother Melissa Kennedy told The Times. She was unarmed when she died. ", Her mother says part of the reason for filing the lawsuit is to find out exactly what happened to her daughter. ," ""It's the only way that people are going to know what happened to her and why,"" Kennedy told the Tribune. ",,
Watch Videos,"In the last two weeks, two different grand juries in the United States chose not to indict police officers who used enough force to kill unarmed black men. People across the country have expressed outrage - and continue to protest against what many see as repeated and racially-charged police brutality. As this country seeks ways to understand and address the troubling divide between the police and the policed, there is one often-overlooked explanation. Education.","Take note of this fact: according to a 2003 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, 83% of all U.S. police departments require a high school diploma, but only 8% require a 4-year college degree. But another study, by 2010 Police Quarterly, revealed that officers with some college education are less likely to resort to force (56% of the time) than those who have never attended college (68% of the time).","And one very well-educated NYPD employee talked about a major barrier to entry into the police force - the sheer amount of time it takes to get there. “From the day you take the test, to the day you get into Academy, the average time is about 3.5 years. Very, very few [educated] people are willing to put their career on hold for 3-4 years after graduation.”","But what role does the level of education play? How does schooling - or lack of it - affect a cop’s mindset, help define an officer’s instincts? What happens during formative years of study that could alter a cop’s perspective?",Dr. Maria Haberfeld of John Jay College of Criminal Justice had some answers.,♦     ♦     ♦,WF: What are your thoughts on the findings that a college education reduces the likelihood of using force?,"MH: One component here that people tend to ignore is the age component. If you go and get your degree first, you’re a couple of years older than the average recruit and at this age, when you’re so young, those couple of years are critical for our emotional development and decision making processes. It’s a huge deal in terms of how emotional you are, how you’re more into assessing things and not just reacting. So this is a very very important element of why we should be looking at higher education.","Education gives you a certain perspective on life and sometimes demystifies certain biases and concepts or preconceived notions about people, situations, and how to handle situations. The critical seconds and minutes that a person has when they have to make the decision whether or not to use force – when all of this is running through your head, these are just additional tools an officer has at his or her disposal.","I think there is a direct correlation between the specific topics police officers are exposed to during an academic career and the use of force. There can be some additional correlation if they’re pursuing degrees in fields related to police work. If they’re exposed to various research findings from studies of police conduct and misconduct, like police ethics for example, it’s an additional tool.","I just feel that especially in the United States, anything that we can offer a police officer in terms of an additional view of the world can add onto the view of the world that they currently possess.",WF: Do certain types of degrees or programs lend themselves better to a career as a police officer than others?,"MH: Classes in ethics, whether it’s police or criminal justice ethics, are classes that give officers additional tools to think about the impact of the use of force beyond a particular moment that generates a desired result. But police community relations are influenced beyond that moment of desired result, and these are things we certainly discuss with them in classes when we talk about police ethics. There’s something I consider perishable versus non-perishable skills. Perishable skills are when you have to memorize the guide to pass the test and the next thing you know you don’t remember anything. But talking about the impact of use of force, the impact of policing and the interactions between police and public, those stay with the community forever. How they influence the perception of the police as a profession…these are the non-perishable skills that you start thinking about beyond just the use force.","WF: What is the average profile of someone entering the police force? Where does the NYPD recruit from, for example?","MH: Depends on the jurisdiction. The majority are people who have high school degrees or GEDs and who don’t necessarily have many other options. Here in New York, the NYPD requires at least an Associate Degree. I think people are looking for a job that’s challenging, that’s not 9-5 behind a desk, but I think that there’s a romanticized notion about the majority of police officers joining to serve and protect. The emphasis currently is whether you have the right background – ethnic, racial, or gender – we want to show how diverse you are but that doesn’t mean anything. I don’t care if I’m policed by a woman, I care that I’m policed by a professional.","WF: In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of presidential commissions recommended that all officers obtain 4-year degrees within the next decade, in the wake of police clashes with civil rights activists. Is there a historical precedent encouraging greater professionalism that we are still ignoring?",MH: Definitely. Police officers are recruited with criminal records. The majority of recruited police officers have misdemeanor records. That’s still a crime. I don’t want police on the job who have committed a crime and violated the law. It’s very nice to give a second chance but not in policing. If you have various violations I’m sorry… the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. So if you think someone who has three misdemeanor convictions is going to be a good police officer…,If you allow yourself to violate the law why would you go and enforce it?,WF: Are the hurdles in forcing police departments to change their policies purely budgetary?,"MH: It’s budgetary, but in my mind it’s about manageability of the police force. People who are more educated tend to ask questions. And sometimes, it’s easier to have people who don’t ask questions or think critically.",WF: Are there resources available for people who are thinking about a career as a cop?,"MH: There are various programs around the country that try to interest high school students in the police force but it’s not about going and trying to interest everybody in the profession. It’s about whether or not you want to be a police officer for the right reasons. I always say we should be recruiting age 25 and above. This is not something for people who are not developed emotionally and psychologically. It’s one thing to send a soldier to kill the enemy 50,000 miles away. It’s another thing to send kids to police the community that they come from.",WF: Have these stats made entry into police forces more competitive?,"MH: No. I mean police departments have to change how they recruit and select if they want to be serious. That absolutely must change. You can have the best training, but if you offer it to the wrong people you’re not achieving anything. You have to strive to find the right people who are going to be recruited."
"Will Neff  | September 16, 2014",,"The case of Timothy Young made
national headlines in 2012 when New Mexico police anally
probed him in search of drugs (no contraband was
found). His ordeal was the result of a false positive
alert by a drug-sniffing police dog. Incredibly, the same dog was
involved in a case involving another New Mexico resident that
resulted in forced rectal exams that uncovered no drugs. That case
ended with authorities paying 
a $1.6 million settlement (Young's case is still
pending). ","Although presented as impartial and infallible, it turns
out that such dogs are not only often poorly trained, they are
frequently wrong.","Cops, explains Andy Falco, a former K-9 handler and officer for
the Anaheim Police Department in California, ""will often motivate
their dog or cue their dog to alert when there's absolutely nothing
there."" A
2011 analysis by the Chicago Tribune of police
departments in the greater Chicago area found that vehicle searches
initiated after dogs alerted failed to turn up drugs or drug
paraphernalia 56 percent of the time. Other studies find false
positives as high as 74 percent and 80 percent.","Yet in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that as long as police
say the dog is trained or accurate, ""a court can
presume that the dog's alert provides probable cause to search""
people, vehicles, and property.","""If [police] have a dog that will alert on cue,"" says
Reason Senior Editor Jacob Sullum, who has written

extensively on the issue, ""that's a very useful tool to have to
search people you have other grounds to think are suspicious.""
Sullum stresses that there are no uniform or reliable certification
standards for training drug-sniffing dogs.","While convinced of dogs' potential usefulness, Falco agrees that
police dogs are generally poorly trained and handled.","Indeed, in the wake of such appalling cases such as Young's in
New Mexico, Falco worries that drug-sniffing dogs will be
completely discredited. ""I've seen cases where people have trained
their own dogs in their backyards and then taken it to work as a
drug dog. I've seen that happen,"" he says. ""We're going to lose
them because we're not using them the way we're supposed to.""","About 4 minutes. Produced by Will Neff. Additional camera by

Ciaramella|Jul. 3, 2018 2:20 pm","Jim Weber/ZUMA Press/NewscomA federal judge has blocked Tennessee's practice of suspending driver's licenses for unpaid court fees without first determining if the debtors are too poor to pay. The policy, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled yesterday, violates poor residents' due process and equal protection rights under the 14th Amendment.","""[A]s applied to indigent drivers, the law is not merely ineffective; it is powerfully counterproductive,"" Trauger wrote. ""If a person has no resources to pay a debt, he cannot be threatened or cajoled into paying it; he may, however, become able to pay it in the future. But taking his driver's license away sabotages that prospect.""",Trauger ordered the state to cease suspending licenses for unpaid court debts and to give all residents who had their licenses suspended for such reasons an opportunity to have them reinstated.,"License suspensions for unpaid court fines, drug violations, and other non-moving violations came into the spotlight in 2014 following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Investigative reporting revealed the town's rapacious use of fines and fees to generate revenue, sparking a nationwide look at how cities use petty fines and fees.","Many states across the U.S. passed license suspension laws to go after scofflaws, but civil liberties groups say they often trap poor residents in a debt spiral by depriving them of the means to make money in the first place.","The two lead plaintiffs of the case, James Thomas and David Hixson, were physically disabled and living in a homeless shelter, respectively. Both had their licenses suspended for unpaid court fines.","States across the country have suspended more than 7 million licenses, according to The Washington Post. Virginia alone suspends 900,000 licenses—11 percent of its total population—at any given time for unpaid fines and fees.","Tennessee suspended 146,211 licenses for unpaid court fines and fees between 2012 and 2016, according to the lawsuit. That doesn't include suspensions for unpaid traffic fines.","Trauger's decision was not a surprise. The judge lambasted the state's policy in earlier decisions in a parallel case challenging suspensions for unpaid traffic fines—one commanding Tennessee to immediately reinstate the licenses of two lead plaintiffs, and the other allowing the lawsuit to proceed as a class action.","In both, Trauger wrote that the practical effects of Tennessee's license suspension policies appeared to be at complete odds with the rules' stated purpose—that is, collecting debt.","""Taking an individual's driver's license away to try to make her more likely to pay a fine is not using a shotgun to do the job of a rifle: it is using a shotgun to treat a broken arm,"" the judge wrote last year.","Trauger noted that Tennessee towns and cities are ""pervasively structured"" around motor vehicles, and that one didn't need ""reams of expert testimony to understand that an individual who cannot drive is at an extraordinary disadvantage in both earning and maintaining material resources.""","In January, another federal judge in Michigan enjoined the practice when it is applied to the very poor, ruling that suspending licenses without determining the debtors' ability to pay likely violates due process.","A lawsuit challenging Virginia's policy was dismissed on technical grounds last year but still spurred the state to reform its practices. Nevertheless, Virginia still suspended nearly 1 million licenses last year.","The Tennessee lawsuit was brought by Civil Rights Corps, a group challenging bail policies and license suspensions in several states, as well as by the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, Just City, and the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell and Berkowitz.","""This is an incredible victory for low-income Tennesseans whose contact with the criminal system leaves them saddled with court debt and unable to get around in a state that lacks adequate public transportation​,"" Civil Rights Corps founder Alec Karakatsanis said following the ruling. ""Today, one immense barrier to escaping the cycle of poverty and criminalization has been removed​—people will be able to go to work, see their families and friends, get to the grocery store and doctor's office, and do all of the things that we all take for granted and that give life meaning.​""",Photo Credit: Jim Weber/ZUMA Press/Newscom,C.J.

But here's the point: I inoculated my dog against rabies, so my dog wasn't rabies-susceptible. So no license required.","Of course, the city pulled the trigger using Florida law to suspend my driver's license. When I found out, I picked up the phone, contacted the animal control morons and let them know that unless my license was reinstated within 24 hours, I would see them in court.","They got the message, and my license was reinstated the same day. Of course, I required the court to send me proof of reinstatement.","I had been quite prepared to point out in court that the prosecutor, the judge and any children they might have were almost certainly ""rabies-susceptible"", were technical ""animals"" and in all likelihood had not been licensed under the ordinance.

After hearing from those officers, the judge decided to allow Vassey to testify.",Vassey’s attorney previously told CNN that Vidal attacked the officer with a screwdriver.,"The grand jury was given the directions to decide if Vassey should be indicted on second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or not be charged at all.","After listening for hours to all the facts, it was their collective judgment that Vassey be indicted on voluntary manslaughter.","“After I reviewed the case I found that a crime almost certainly did take place,” explained David. “It was a ‘bad shoot.’ A grand jury has agreed.”","According to his stepfather, Vidal had been tased and was pinned to the ground by two other law enforcement officers when Vassey stepped between them and fired a single, killing shot.",Vassey has also been suspended without pay.

"J.D. Tuccille|Aug. 5, 2014 11:04 am","Barry Township PD Facebook pageBarry Township, Michigan, with
a population of about 4,000, has four full-time
police officers, four part-time officers, two Humvees, two
armored personnel carriers (free, courtesy of the 
Defense Department's 1033 program)—and, until recently, about
three dozen unpaid but armed and empowered reserve police officers
patrolling the streets. All those cops need to find something to do
with themselves, and many of the people of Barry Township are more
than a bit bent out of shape that they've been on the receiving end
of that something.","Writes L.L. Brasier of the 
Detroit Free Press:","Early morning May 10, Jack Nadwornik stepped behind Tujax
Tavern, the bar and restaurant he has owned for 30 years in this
small, western Michigan town.","Nadwornik, out drinking with friends for his 58th birthday,
urinated in a corner of the empty parking lot because the bar was
locked up.","Within seconds, two Barry Township police cars and three
officers — two of them unpaid reserves — confronted him as he was
zipping up his pants. What happened next is up for debate: Police
said he resisted arrest. Nadwornick said he didn’t, and a waitress
who was leaving work agreed.","What everyone does agree on is the aftermath: Nadwornik had a
broken hand from a police baton, bloody elbows, and he had been
kneed in the back. He was handcuffed, jailed and charged with
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, a two-year felony.","If this was just a one-off incident, Nadwornik's friends would
be bent out of shape and his lawyer would be prepping a lawsuit.
But this is only one high-profile incident in a sleepy town where
people complain that the cops are out of control, and police chief
Victor Pierce justifies his paramilitary machine on the grounds of
""terrorism, barricaded gunmen and mass shootings.""","Oh, yeah. And God.","""I have preached a vision and the Lord put me here for a
reason,"" he told the township board.","Barry TownshipThe township's insurance company finally forced
the police chief to make his small army of reserve officers stand

town of Oakley, population 290, to put its army of 100 reserve

the high school to accommodate attendees, the township board

",Chicago police superintendent Garry McCarthy is not happy about the new concealed carry laws in Illinois.  And now he is predicting that police will shoot citizens who are lawfully carrying firearms.,During an interview with WVON radio McCarthy made some very bold statements that show his disdain for the 2nd amendment.,"“You put more guns on the street expect more shootings,” McCarthy said. “I don’t care if they’re licensed legal firearms, people who are not highly trained… putting guns in their hands is a recipe for disaster. So I’ll train our officers that there is a concealed carry law, but when somebody turns with a firearm in their hand the officer does not have an obligation to wait to get shot to return fire and we’re going to have tragedies as a result of that. I’m telling you right up front.”","While every cop has a right to protect himself, this bold statement by McCarthy is obviously meant to intimidate gun owners who choose to exercise their rights.  This threat that cops may mistakenly shoot a gun carrying citizen is just another attempt to fight the concealed carry laws that Illinois has long been deprived of.","McCarthy would not say what specific training officers will undertake if any. However, he did admit that in the past his department has made mistakes in shooting unarmed civilians. He believes the concealed carry law will increase those types of unfortunate incidents.","“You say concealed carry I say Trayvon Martin. Police officers make mistakes all the time,” McCarthy said. “We spend six months in the police academy, six months of field training and ongoing training on a regular basis and the fact is once in a while we’re going to shoot someone with a cellphone; we’re going to shoot somebody with a flashlight and none of that is okay. But now you take John Q. Civilian, you give them six weeks or 10 weeks of training and you say ‘have at it?’ The fact is more guns are not the solution to the firearm gun violence problem in this country. Less guns and reasonable gun laws are. And just because it’s 49 states to one doesn’t mean the state of Illinois is wrong on that one.”","So McCarthy is slamming  gun carrying citizens for not having the training of a police officer, and yet he predicts that his heavily trained cops will be shooting law abiding gun carrying citizens.  Makes sense?","Perhaps if cops in Chicago worried less about the law abiding citizen’s rights and more about the gangs and criminals that are ignoring gun laws, the windy city would be a safer place.","Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation.  This is a gun control haven.  And yet in 2012 there were 2,364 shooting incidents.","While it’s a sad truth that police officers do sometime make mistakes and shoot the wrong person, predicting that his training will result in gun carrying citizens being shot is way over the line.  If you agree feel free to share this post and leave a comment below.",,Filed Under: Gun Rights ,"

Eric Sprott reviews the week that was and looks ahead to what will be an interesting and consequential week next.,"Free and Safe trading with a ""twist""...?",Click and enjoy....,"The number of police officers who died in the line of duty dropped to its lowest level in four years in 2017, thanks to advances in safety gear and training, Russia Today reported.","As of Thursday, 128 federal, state and local law enforcement officers died in the line of duty in 2017, a decrease of 10 percent from last year, according to a preliminary report from the nonprofit National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF) released Thursday.","The total number of officers killed in the line of duty this year is the lowest since 2013, when 117 officers were killed. The number of officer fatalities had been on the rise for the past three consecutive years, reaching a peak of 143 fatalities in 2016.","“After three consecutive years of rising deaths in the law enforcement profession, this year’s decline offered some encouraging news,” Craig Floyd, NLEOMF CEO, said in a statement.","The number of officers killed in the line of duty has been on the decline since the ‘70s, when there was an average of 234 fatalities reported annually.", ,"Firearms-related law enforcement fatalities decreased in 2017.

Floyd said the drop is most likely due to advances in safety gear, such as bullet-proof vests and de-escalation training.","“In my 33 years doing this, I've never seen the amount of awareness given to officer safety and wellness,” Floyd said. “That's definitely been paying off and will continue to help make law enforcement a significantly safer profession.”","The average age of an officer killed in the line of duty this year was 42. On average, officers left behind two children. The state with the highest number of officer deaths was Texas, with 14 fatalities. A total of 14 states and the District of Columbia did not suffer any officer fatalities in 2017.","Randy Sutton, a former police lieutenant and spokesman for Blue Lives Matter, attributes the decrease in police fatalities to the so-called “Ferguson effect,” referring to nationwide protests triggered by the killing of an unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014.","“There's a saying in law enforcement: You can't get in trouble for the car stop you don't make,” Sutton said. “They don't want to be the next Ferguson, the next officer burned on the stake.”","However, the number of people killed by officers increased from 963 in 2016 to 971 this year, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.","But even though the number of on duty deaths continues to decline, the unprecedented militarization of local police departments continues.","Over the summer, President Donald Trump signed an executive order clearing the way for local police in America to receive military gear such as grenade launchers, high-caliber weapons, and armored vehicles.

"John Stossel  | August 21, 2013","We need police to catch murderers, thieves and con men, and so
we give them special power -- the power to use force on others.
Sadly, today’s police use that power to invade people’s homes over
accusations of trivial, nonviolent offenses -- and often do it with
tanks, battering rams and armor you’d expect on battlefields.",Scott Shackford|12.13.18,Joe Setyon|12.12.18,Joe Setyon|12.10.18,12.12.18 12:01 am,12.11.18 9:15 am,12.04.18 9:46 am,"In his book “Rise of the Warrior Cop,” Radley Balko recounts the
rise of police SWAT teams (SWAT stands for Special Weapons And
Tactics) armed with heavy military equipment. SWAT raids began as
rarely used methods of dealing with violent situations, like
hostage-takings.",But government always grows.,"In the 1970s, there were about 300 SWAT raids per year. “As of
2005,” says Balko, “100 to 150 per day.” ","What began as a few specialized groups of police trained to
address genuine threats to safety has degenerated into small armies
descending on organic farms where farmers sell unpasteurized milk
and legal medical marijuana dispensaries getting raided as if they
were heavily armed threats.","The increase began under Nixon-era politicians who wanted to
look “tough on crime,” even if that meant exaggerating the threat
posed by illegal drugs. As the futile war on drugs escalated, cops
worried that drug users would destroy evidence if cops knocked and
announced themselves. So they stopped doing that, changing a
centuries-old rule that treated citizens’ homes as their castles --
castles whose owners must be presented with a warrant before police
can enter.","Soon, every police department wanted a SWAT team -- and many
were more interested in getting cool military gear than in
considering the potential downside -- like terrorizing innocent
people, raiding the wrong house
and causing violence.","“I found over 50 cases where a completely innocent person was
killed in one of these raids,” says Balko. Often this happens
because the homeowner does not realize who is breaking down his
door in the middle of the night. ","Iraq War veteran Jose Guerena just knew that armed men were
bursting in. So he picked up his semi-automatic rifle. Before he
could take the safety off, police fired 71 bullets, hitting him 22
times.  ","Police raided his house because they suspected drugs were there.
But after Guerena was killed, police found no drugs and no evidence
of drug dealing. Today, the vast majority of SWAT raids are about
drugs, not terrorism or hostage situations. Guerena’s brother was
arrested on drug charges. Balko says, “It appears Guerena’s crime
was being related to someone.”","Now that the public is finally starting to have doubts about the
drug war, another type of war has arrived: the War on
Terror. The idea that domestic enemies need to be raided and
rooted out -- that law enforcement should be given a free hand or
we could all be killed -- got a new lease on life.",And a new source of funding.,"Despite laws clearly saying that soldiers may not be used for
domestic policing except in very special circumstances, the
Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security now offer armored
vehicles -- tanks and troop transports, body armor and stun
grenades -- to police departments, large or small. ","Local police jumped at the chance to have new toys -- so they
expanded the circumstances under which those toys get
used. ","The police chief in quiet Concord, N.H., cites people not so
different from me as an excuse for getting DHS
money to buy an armored vehicle. In an application for what is
essentially a tank, he wrote that groups like the Free State
Project -- libertarians who moved to New Hampshire seeking
increased individual freedom -- pose “daily challenges” to the
police of Concord.","Free Staters better watch out next time they get into an
argument over a traffic ticket.","Most libertarians argue that police, courts and military are
legitimate functions of government. We focus our skepticism on
completely illegitimate government actions, like corporate
welfare.","But few freedoms are more basic than being able to sleep
securely in your bed without armored men bursting through your
door. ","John Stossel joined Reason in 2017.

"When even video evidence of another police killing doesn’t lead to indictments anymore, you know we need to upend this miscarriage of justice",Contact author,"

Thu 4 Dec 2014 11.41 EST

","Grand juries were designed to be a check on prosecutors and law enforcement. Instead, they’ve become a corrupt shield to protect those with power and another sword to strike down those without. And it’s now all too obviously past time the system was overhauled to fix that.","Before Wednesday’s shameful decision by a New York grand jury to refuse to indict the police officer who choked to death an unarmed and unresisting Eric Garner, one statistic made clear just how much our justice system has failed: ","Grand juries not resulting in indictments: Police Officers: 80 of 81 Civilians: 11 of 162,000 #Ferguson http://t.co/rmHtPlNlun","If you are an ordinary citizen being investigated for a crime by an American grand jury, there is a 99.993% chance you’ll be indicted. Yet if you’re a police officer, that chance falls to effectively nil.","While the Michael Brown tragedy in Ferguson elevated the harsh reality of grand juries to the global stage, no case has driven it home more than Garner’s. A victim who was unarmed and did not resist. A forbidden chokehold according to NYPD rules. Ruled a homicide by the medical examiner who performed the autopsy. And it was all caught on crystal-clear video.","If Eric Garner’s killer can’t be indicted, what cop possibly could? ",The man is unarmed. The chokehold is banned. The coroner ruled it a homicide. It is on video. None of this matters. I can't breathe.,"Grand juries require prosecutors to prove there was probable cause – that is, more probable than not – that a crime has been committed, before a case moves to trial. Yet they’ve turned into a two-tiered justice system wherein prosecutors are able to manipulate grand juries into pretty much whatever decision they please, and absolve themselves of any accountability when they rig the system for their allies.","In cases where the prosecutor wants an indictment, he or she can show the jury a narrow slice of favorable evidence (sometimes evidence that wouldn’t even be allowed at trial), then pressure the jury over which charges to bring, and get an indictment within hours. “There is no question that a grand jury will do precisely what the prosecutor wants, virtually 100% of the time,” law professor James Cohen told Gothamist on Monday, echoing the comments of countless other lawyers over the past few weeks.","But in cases where prosecutors don’t want a trial, they can bury the jury in evidence and drag on the process for weeks, then undermine the case by cross-examining their own witnesses, and confuse the jury by not recommending which charges to bring at all. The result is what we’ve seen from Ferguson to Staten Island and back again: miscarriage of justice, under the auspices of thoroughness.","In local cases involving local cops, it’s clear that local prosecutors won’t cut it. Federal prosecutions and some states require grand juries to reach indictments, but that doesn’t mean states can’t bring in special prosecutors without connections to cases of the local police. As criminal law professor Ronald Wright told the New Republic, local ballot initiatives can quickly make this practice mandatory: ",You could revise state law so that you could describe the category of cases where the appointment of a special prosecutor is mandatory. The governor shall appoint a special prosecutor in the possible criminal wrongdoing by police officer in jurisdiction with the same boundary as the district attorney. You could have an automatic trigger.,"NYC Public Advocate @TishJames calls on governor to create a special prosecutor to prosecute police, citing conflict of interest #EricGarner","Many made the immediate point on Wednesday evening that if even Garner’s killer, captured on video, could not be indicted, then clearly body-cams won’t lead to more indictments. But the idea that body-cams were even going to be a partial solution for stopping senseless killings by police officers was absurd and insulting before the Garner decision was announced. The only people who actually think body-cams are a viable solution are the people defending the killings to begin with.","But that does not mean there is no value in the fact that the killing of Eric Garner was caught on camera. The video of Garner’s death means that the world’s public knows the truth, even if a misled group of grand jurors in New York refused to face it. It also means the Justice Department has ample evidence to open a federal civil rights investigation into the incident, which Eric Holder said on Wednesday night that it will. If the killing wasn’t on film, politicians wouldn’t be feeling increased pressure from incensed protesters of all backgrounds to finally face the issue of two-tiered justice head-on.","Right now, though, we don’t even have an accurate count of how many people police kill each year, let alone a fair system for bringing some justice to those unjustified killings – to the families of Mike Brown, Eric Garner and the many victims who are not household names. The Wall Street Journal reported just before the Garner grand jury decision was announced that literally hundreds of killings by police officers went unreported over the last several years. The road to accountability is long, but as the public gets more and more outraged, we can only hope it bends towards justice."

December 8, 2018 5:00 am","New Jersey law enforcement officials refused to say on Thursday how they planned to go about enforcing the state's ban on the possession of any magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, which goes into effect on Monday.",Neither the state police nor the attorney general's office elaborated on how they plan to enforce the law. Nor did they provide any guidance for those currently in possession of the magazines.,"The law, signed by Gov. Phil Murphy in June along with five other new gun laws, gave New Jersey gun owners who currently possess the magazines in question 180 days to either surrender them, permanently modify them to only accept up to 10 rounds, or transfer them to somebody who is allowed to legally own them. The deadline is set to expire on Monday.","A lawsuit brought by the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs and supported by the National Rifle Association failed on Thursday as the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals declared the confiscation law constitutional. Any civilian caught in possession of a magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds may be arrested and prosecuted. Possession of such magazines after the deadline will be considered a crime of the fourth degree under state law and carry up to 18 months in prison and up to $10,000 in fines or both.",Nearly all modern full-size or compact handguns and rifles sold in the United States come standard with magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.,State police told the Washington Free Beacon the effort to enforce the law will be a statewide endeavor directed by the attorney general's office. They would not comment other than to say they will enforce New Jersey's laws.,"""We will enforce the law of the state,"" Lieutenant Theodore Schafer of the New Jersey State Police said. ""That's our plan.""",Schafer would not give any details on the agency's plan to enforce the law and referred the Free Beacon to the attorney general's office for further questions.,"Leland Moore, a public information officer for the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, refused to answer any questions on how the state planned to deal with gun owners who did not comply with the new law. He would not say if the attorney general has any guidance at all for those who currently own the magazines being targeted, which gun-rights activists have estimated to be up to a million New Jersey residents, or provide any insight about how the state will deal with those who don’t turn in, modify, or destroy their magazines.","""We have no comment,"" Moore said to multiple inquiries.","When pressed about whether everyone in possession of such magazines would be arrested and prosecuted, he refused to comment. When asked if officers might be sent ""door to door"" as some critics fear about such confiscation efforts, he refused to comment.","""We've answered your query,"" Moore said. ""We have no comment.""","The law does not appear to provide any funding or direction for any sort of additional enforcement efforts beyond normal police activity. There have been no reports of additional mobilization of police forces or any instructions to patrol for the magazines in question. Still, the attorney general's office would not say what tactics or efforts would be used in carrying out the law.","In a 2-1 vote, the 3rd Circuit ruled the magazine confiscation law could go into effect because it does not violate either the Second, Fifth, or 14th Amendment as plaintiffs had claimed.","Judge Patty Shwartz, an Obama appointee, wrote for the majority that the law serves a legitimate public safety purpose.","""Today we address whether one of New Jersey's responses to the rise in active and mass shooting incidents in the United States—a law that limits the amount of ammunition that may be held in a single firearm magazine to no more than ten rounds—violates the Second Amendment, the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause,"" she wrote. ""We conclude that it does not. New Jersey's law reasonably fits the State's interest in public safety and does not unconstitutionally burden the Second Amendment's right to self-defense in the home. The law also does not violate the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause because it does not require gun owners to surrender their magazines but instead allows them to retain modified magazines or register firearms that have magazines that cannot be modified. Finally, because retired law enforcement officers have training and experience that makes them different from ordinary citizens, the law's exemption that permits them to possess magazines that can hold more than ten rounds does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.""","Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, dissented by saying the state did not meet the burden of proving they haven't violated the Second Amendment.","""The Second Amendment is an equal part of the Bill of Rights,"" he wrote. ""And the Supreme Court has repeatedly told us not to treat it differently. So, we must apply strict scrutiny to protect people's core right to defend themselves and their families in their homes. That means holding the government to a demanding burden of proof. Here, the government has offered no concrete evidence that magazine restrictions have saved or will save potential victims. Nor has it made any showing of tailoring.""","Gurbir Grewal, New Jersey's attorney general, tweeted on Thursday that the decision is a ""big win for public safety and law enforcement safety"" and upheld ""a sensible law to address mass shootings.""","The case, however, may not be settled. The Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs promised on Thursday to appeal the decision.","""This decision is plainly wrong and upholds New Jersey's unconstitutional law turning one million honest citizens into felons for keeping property obtained legally that could be used for defending their lives,"" Scott Bach, head of the gun-rights group, told the Hill.

"SACRAMENTO (CBS13) – Christopher Dorner, the ex-LAPD officer accused of three revenge killings and the focus of an extensive manhunt, left behind a long manifesto outlining all of his grievances and observations. ","That manifesto gave investigators some clues to Dorner’s wherebouts, but the search continues. Law enforcement officers spent four hours searching his mother’s Orange County home where they removed 10 grocery bags filled with evidence.","Dorner lost his job with the Los Angeles Police Department in 2008. His manifesto vows revenge for that incident, and surprisingly, thousands of people actually support him. One Facebook page says Dorner should run for president of the United States. “We propose electing a man who could no longer sit idly by and watch as malicious tyrants abuse the innocent.”","The description on the page “We Are All Chris Dorner” chillingly says, “Yes, this is war.” And nearly 3,000 people like the page “I Support Christopher Jordan Dorner.”",CBS13 posted a simple question: Why? Why support a man wanted for at least three killings and the author of a murderous manifesto promising to target cops?,"One sympathizer replied, “Because something needs to be done about the long known corruption of not only the LAPD, but several agencies.”","Another comment read, “He is god for now and I support him and this page.”","“Most people would be shocked and appalled that people would support this,” said Sid Martinez, assistant professor of sociology at Sacramento State.","However, Martinez is not surprised by the outpouring of support. He points to a long history of distrust and tension between parts of Southern California and the police as the motivation behind the movement. Some see Dorner’s actions as a sick kind of justice.","“So, to see someone kill police officers, they may see this as a kind of way of standing against oppressive force,” said Martinez.","A number of fake Twitter accounts have popped up and are only adding to debate, which some still find surprising.",Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:,"

",Civilians seeking to video record their encounters with cops inside NYPD precincts should hit pause — the practice could land them in cuffs.,"A day after a civilian posted video of himself launching into a vulgar tirade against a 28th Precinct sergeant inside the Upper Manhattan station house, the department issued new guidelines directing cops to arrest those who won’t stop recording.","Anyone videotaping inside these facilities will first be asked to stop recording, according to the memo, released on Wednesday and citing a recent update to the department’s patrol guide. If a person won’t stop recording, they will be asked to leave — and those who still refuse can be arrested, the document states.","However, recording police activity in public spots — streets, parks and private property — is a First Amendment right, the memo reminds officers.",The document also directs police to arrest those who act in a manner “so disruptive as to meaningfully interfere with police operations within a police facility” if they refuse to stop or leave when directed.,"But the department cautioned cops that “conduct is not illegal merely because of the officer’s subjective feelings about the person’s statements, even if the statements consist of insults and ridicule.”",The memo was released only two days after a man berated and threatened to sexually assault officers inside Harlem’s 28th Precinct stationhouse.,"“Sergeant Lopez, he can suck a big fat f–king d–k,” the man said, according to video taken Monday and posted to Instagram the following day. “Shut the f–k up, b—h,” he barked at the sergeant seconds later.","“I’m going to put it in your f–king a–,” the man added.","The sergeant and the man then got into an argument about whether he was allowed to record inside the precinct, with the belligerent man saying: “I can record; I can do what the f–k I want.”","The man walked out of the precinct and was not arrested, a police source said.","

"createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath                                            AP                                    Cleveland police officials said Friday they're  disciplining 75 of officers for their involvement in  a police chase that ended in the shooting deaths of an unarmed man and woman, The Plain Dealer reports. "," The pair were shot at 137 times while in their car, parked in a middle school parking lot. No officers were injured in what police called a  ""full blown-out"" firefight. "," Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine told reporters in February that ""there is nothing normal about this case. ... This is a tragedy."" "," In November, about  60 police vehicles pursued the two suspects  in a 25-minute chase spanning three cities. One suspect, 30-year-old Malissa Williams, was shot 24 times, and the other, 43-year-old Timothy Russell, was shot 23 times. "," At the time,  police said the suspects fired shots at them near Cleveland's downtown Justice Center, according to The Plain Dealer. And a police dispatcher said that shots were fired at officers during the chase. "," But after the chase ended in a gunfight near Heritage Middle School, police checked the car and realized neither Williams nor Russell was armed. ", It isn't clear whether a shot was actually fired at the officer who initiated the chase. Some speculate the Malibu driven by Russell may have backfired. , A report from the state's attorney general shows the officers likely believe the suspects were armed based on erroneous information broadcast over the police radio. Officers told investigators they saw the suspects in the car with what looked like a gun. ," Russell might have fled from police initially, fueling the massive chase,  because he was high and driving on a suspended license. Toxicology results show that Russell was  under the influence of cocaine and alcohol at the time of his death. Williams was also high on cocaine and had marijuana in her system. "," The officers being disciplined for violating police protocol won't lose their jobs and did not partake in the gunfight at the end of the chase, but they did have a role in the pursuit. More than 100 police officers were involved in the chase in some way. "," Nineteen of the 75 officers facing discipline for offenses ranging from engaging in a chase without permission to providing false information on police reports will have disciplinary hearings and might be suspended temporarily, according to The Plain Dealer. "," In 2011, the newspaper  published an investigation of reports of excessive use of nondeadly force by Cleveland police officers. The newspaper found that the police chief often overlooked inconsistencies with police officers' stories when investigating use of force incidents.                                                                                                     ", Many of the officers faced accusations of brutality on the force. ,,

","It states officers entered and ""fired 48 times"" and later argued about ""who shot the deceased and which deputy shot first."" ",Attorney Richard Brooks represented Margeson and has filed multiple lawsuits against White County's Sheriff.,"""They went down there with the intent to kill in my opinion,"" Brooks said.","""White County is the closest thing to the wild west that we've got around here in a small county,"" Brooks said.",NewsChannel 5 Investigates has learned that 30 of the department's 50 lawsuits involve civil rights violations or law enforcement procedure. ,"White County's insurance picked up the bulk of those claims covering $500,000.","But taxpayers shelled out an additional $82,000, and several cases are still pending.",A recent lawsuit resulted after we obtained dash camera video from 2016. ,It shows deputies surrounding the home of Jessica Newnum while she was sleeping.,"""The sheriff opened up my bedroom door with a gun pointed at me telling me he had a warrant to search my house, but he never showed me anything,"" Newnum said.",Sheriff Shoupe was looking for his nephew - a fugitive who had missed a court date.,Audio from the dash cam reveals how shocked she was the sheriff was in her home.,"Sheriff: ""You don't know him?

The sleeves of his top were short enough to reveal a tattoo reading ""Win Some"" on his right forearm and one reading ""Lose Sum"" on the left. From the court's gallery where dozens of reporters and community members sat, he seemed barely to move as the families of the two men he had killed four months before came forward to speak. "," ""The only thing I'll say is I don't has no sympathy for the man who shot and killed my son,"" said Jerry Ray's father, Paul, his voice breaking. The wife of the other victim, Gary Blanton, said Drum's followers were harassing her and her family—spitting at them, parking at night outside her home. ""Tell your supporters to stop,"" she said. ""My children and I don't deserve this… I think we've suffered enough."" "," As far as Drum was concerned, he had been protecting the community's children. "," Prosecutor Deb Kelly recommended life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murders, plus time for burglary and unlawful possession of a firearm. ""What Mr. Drum has done diminishes us all,"" she said. ""There is no room for vigilantism. There is no room for what he has done. And no one in authority will ever tolerate vigilantism. It will be sought out, those who commit it will be sought out. They will be sought—"" "," Drum interrupted her. ""This country was founded on vigilantism,"" he said. "," Kelly ignored him and continued. ""You piece of shit,"" someone from the galley called to Drum. "," The defense attorney spoke briefly. Drum rose and curtly apologized for the hurt caused to the families, asking his supporters to leave them alone. ""As for the men themselves,"" he said, speaking of his victims, ""actions speak louder than words."" "," The judge gave Drum a sentence of life without parole. ""See you in hell, fucker,"" someone shouted as he departed. ""Love you guys,"" Drum said to the crowd. ""God bless you,"" said another. "," As far as Drum was concerned, he had been protecting the community's children when he murdered Paul Ray's son and Leslie Blanton's husband. He may have killed two sex offenders in June of that year, but he had set out to kill sixty more.                                                             ","In the months after the killings, Drum's case had divided the small community. Both Sequim, where Drum and his victims had lived at the time of the murders, and Port Angeles, an adjacent town where Drum spent most of his life, lie in the rain shadow of Washington's Olympic Mountains and are relatively small—just 7,000 and 19,000 residents, respectively. Mills were the lifeblood of this area, but many closed during the worst of the recession. A few years ago, Twilight fans flocked to the region on pilgrimages to the nearby city of Forks, the main setting of the fantasy novels and films, but Twilight tourism eventually tapered off. Off the main highways, large houses are mixed in with cabins and shacks. There are horses fenced in on private properties, fields and apple trees, snow-capped mountains and the cool waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. ","Kay Gerdes/Sequima.govEveryone knew about the murders. Many residents showed their support by writing letters and showing up at court. Some said they had been raped and that Drum was their hero. Courtroom spectators would yell things like ""Way to go!"" during proceedings. "," As stories of the murders were posted online, comments from readers around the country poured in. Drum was a star and a hero. Drum had no right to play God. He had watched too much television. How could anyone support a murderer? How could anyone support a sex offender? Where could they send Drum money? More still seemed unsure how to feel: They disliked sex offenders, but didn't know if murder was the solution. "," To those who supported Drum, any ethical objections to murder were outweighed by the need to protect children. Discussing the case online, one reader commented, ""If it were my child, I would […] think of [Drum] as a hero…sex offenses can be a life long agony and pain."" Another wrote simply, ""Looks like he took out the trash."" A man interviewed on camera outside the Clallam County Courthouse said, ""I honestly feel that it was justified."" "," In fact, Drum's crime wasn't as unusual as it seemed. Between 15 to 20 percent of convicted sex offenders report vigilantism or harassment; According to Professor Jill Levenson of Lynn University in Florida, about one-third of offenders lose their jobs or homes, are harassed, or have property damaged because of their status. In some cases, children grow up to attack those who hurt them when they were young. In 2012,  a man from San Jose, California, beat the priest who allegedly raped him and his brother when they were children. In other cases, the attackers have no connection to the offenders, as in 2011 when  a St. Louis man allegedly approached a 74-year-old neighbor whom he knew was a registered sex offender and asked to borrow sugar. He allegedly attacked the man, who had been charged with sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl in 1991, with a hammer. He later told police that he was ""doing God's work."" "," Vigilantes, and especially those who target pedophiles, often harbor a deep belief that they're doing what's necessary to protect others from grave harm. ""They think the state's not doing enough,"" said Dr. Lisa Arellano, a historian and professor who studies vigilantism at Colby College in Maine. ""And I think those two claims go hand in hand—the state isn't doing enough to protect your community, so you have to do something."" ","Those who knew Drum from his years in Sequim said he was the kind of person who wrote poetry and helped neighbors learn how to send e-mails. Friends said Drum liked being a mentor to young people, including two teenage boys who Drum learned had been molested by Jerry Ray, one of the men Drum would eventually kill. Drum said he knew the boys from the time they were young, and took them fishing when they were teenagers. "," While he was a student at a local community college, Drum started a boxing team and, when he left the school, he coached youth boxers in the area. ""I got a vibe from him that he had had some challenges in his life and he wanted to be a part of something that kids in our community who had had a rough life, like his perhaps, could have something to work on that was drug free and alcohol free,"" Point Peninsula College athletics director Rick Ross said.                                                             "," Drum spent much of his early life in and out of jail, mostly for drug-related offenses. When he was released for the last time in 2009, he seemed to be making an honest effort at starting anew. A stint at a homeless shelter led to a brief dish washing job and, then, a job at Nash's Organic Grocery as a farm laborer. Drum worked there for three years while trying his hand bottling water from Forks to sell to Twilight fans and creating an uncommissioned logo for the Seattle Seahawks. Although his ventures were commercially unsuccessful, a local paper profiled him in 2011 as an inspiring example of an ex-felon getting back on his feet. He was laid off from his farm job not long after, but seemed to be holding things together. "," Drum had become friends with Leslie Blanton (née Sheriff), a thick woman with dark hair, in the early 2000s. They were both involved in the drug scene of Port Angeles and became closer after spending some time in rehab together. Leslie Blanton and her boyfriend Gary Blanton Jr., a lanky young man who had been in and out of prison after some violent encounters, both pled guilty to kidnapping. They allegedly forced a girl into a car, kept her in an apartment against her will and hit her in the head with their hands and a frying pan. Gary Blanton was released first and, when Leslie Blanton was released a couple years later, they married. "," The pair had two children together: Gary III, who was born in 2009, and Skylar, who was born in 2010. Blanton, Leslie says, was a dedicated father, bringing her meals when she was pregnant and reading to her stomach so the babies would get to know his voice. As a husband, he helped her reform her life. "," Yet something about Gary Blanton bothered Drum, who kept in touch with the couple and came to dinner occasionally, bringing groceries from the farm where he worked. When he was 17, Blanton had pled guilty to raping a 17-year-old deaf/mute girl. Leslie didn't mind what had happened: Her husband had come clean with her early in their relationship. (She would later say in court that Gary had been caught having sex with the girl in public, while his mother said he was set up by the girl and charged with statutory rape. Because both Gary Blanton and the girl were minors, details of the case are sealed.) But Drum withdrew from them slightly after he found out. "," In the summer of 2011, then-17-month-old Skylar was diagnosed with a spiral fracture in his arm, a type of break that doctors said would have required relatively great force unless he had a bone disease, which he did not. The alternative was that someone might have seized the baby forcefully by his arm while he was lying down. Doctors also discovered another, 2-week-old fracture on Skylar's thighbone consistent with someone roughly grabbing him by the arm and forcing him to kneel. In an email to a detective, the doctor wrote, ""In summary, Skylar is the victim of child abuse, and at least the second injury, the upper arm fracture, occurred at the hands of his father.""                                                             "," The family contended that Gary hadn't hurt the baby. But Blanton was arrested, and released on bail on the condition that he stay away from his children. "," In May, Drum visited Blanton at Mandi Smith's residence, where he had been staying since he could no longer live at home. Drum noticed Blanton ""throwing his weight around,"" eating Smith's food without asking, and saying things Drum found disrespectful. Blanton also hadn't packed up his belongings despite being asked to leave. Drum asked Blanton about the situation, but was told to butt out. At that point, Drum recalls jumping up and punching Blanton in the face and, as Smith later told police, the two started brawling. She called Leslie Blanton at work in hopes that she could help but, by the time she showed up, the two men had calmed down. "," Afterward, Drum did something unusual. He asked Gary Blanton if he'd like to stay with him in the cottage he rented in Sequim for a while. Blanton accepted. Soon, he moved in, bringing his dog with him. "," Even though they were living apart, Leslie said she and her husband still spoke on the phone daily. She remembered hearing him and Drum joke together while they made dinner. She later remarked that they seemed like old buddies. Though she noticed Drum had barely been at home since Gary had moved in, and saw him uncharacteristically driving a new, red Chevrolet Impala in place of his usual older car, nothing seemed to be horribly amiss. ", The accommodation seemed like a generous offer.                                                             ," In fact, it was the first step in the plan Drum had been contemplating for years. Only later would Drum admit that the apparent generosity was a ruse. He stole a gun, planned an escape route and started gathering the names and addresses of other sex offenders in the area. ""I invited him to move in with me rent free as a way to get him to a secure location to execute him,"" Drum would later write from prison. ""He took the bait."" The red Impala had been rented as a getaway vehicle. "," On the night of June 2, 2012, Gary Blanton was playing World of Warcraft on his desktop computer. Blanton's dog sat nearby while he fought monsters and embarked on quests in his gray plaid pajama bottoms. "," Though Drum had been planning for this night for weeks, he still spent most of the morning scrambling to get food and camping supplies together. He was always running late. "," While Blanton was immersed in his game, Drum slipped out of the house and cut the power. Blanton was wearing a headset that let him speak with other players and Drum didn't want anyone online to hear what was about to happen. Calming himself, Drum pulled out a 9 mm pistol and charged inside. He hadn't thought about how hard it would be to hit Blanton in the dark and emptied the first magazine wildly into the blackness before realizing he'd need another. He dashed to get an extra from his car and to nab a flashlight. When he re-entered, Blanton, riddled with bullets, was on his cell phone. ""Help, 9-1-1 I'm being shot,"" Blanton managed to say before the line went dead. Drum shone the light on Blanton's head and kept shooting. "," Afterward, Drum led Blanton's dog, scared and splattered with a bit of Blanton's blood but otherwise unscathed, into another room before placing a letter titled ""Declarations"" and a lollipop with a scorpion inside near Blanton's body. The end of his note read: ""When I was younger I was at a pet shop. I saw these three scorpions in [an] aquarium. One was a pregnant female and two were males. As I approached, the female tucked into a protective ball. The two males got in front of her in full battle ready posture; tails up, claws out and open. Being young and curious I played a game and used my hands to circle the aquarium in different directions. Each male picked a hand and moved with it, never leaving her side and staying between the hand and her. This spirit always impressed me."" It was signed with his name.                                                             "," Drum grabbed a backpack stuffed with a thumb drive, camouflage clothes, a map, supplies for living on the run, and a plastic bag full of pot. Then, he left. He carried a list of 60 names and addresses of sex offenders. Drum picked those who had been charged with rape or other serious crimes. He didn't want to target someone who was on the list for peeing in public or another minor offense. They lived in Forks, Sequim, Quilcene—all towns on the Peninsula. They were all in his sights, but first Drum had someone particular in mind. ","Jerry Ray                                            Clallam County Sheriff's Office                                    It was around sunrise when Drum came to the home of his next target. Jerry Ray, a tall 57-year-old man with a graying mustache and glasses, lived with and cared for his elderly father, Paul. Jerry Ray was born in Mississippi, but spent much of his life in California, including a stint in the Army in Fort Ord in the mid-1970s. He had had two marriages, one of which ended in divorce and the other in separation, and had three children. Of his son, Paul Ray would later say, ""Jerry wasn't no angel."" "," In 2002, Jerry Ray was found guilty of having stripped naked, carrying the 7 and 4-year-old grandchildren of his friends (the boys Drum said he walked across the street and took on fishing trips) into a bedroom, and molesting them. Jerry Ray later told police he was drunk and barely remembered the evening, but admitted that he had acted on a strange urge. He served four years of jail time and underwent sex offender therapy as well as rehab for alcoholism, although he struggled with his addiction until his death. "," After his release from prison, a back injury prevented Jerry Ray from working and so he spent his time shopping for groceries, taking his father to doctor's appointments, and keeping busy around their house with their three Pekingese dogs, black Persian cat, and gray and white parakeet named Tweety. He also took care of his mother until she died of Alzheimer's. "," Drum had been waiting for years for the moment when he would get revenge on this man who molested the children he knew. He had had plans to come to Jerry Ray's home and stab him on New Year's Eve before his arrest in 2005 for burglary. ""I am close friends with the family and what I did was long overdue,"" he would write later, adding that they had no idea that he was planning to hurt Ray. But, now, on the porch of the Ray home, Drum hesitated. He had heard that Jerry Ray was ex-military and it wasn't uncommon for people in this rural area to have guns. He tried knocking, hoping Jerry Ray would answer the door so Drum could shoot him and make a quick escape. Nobody answered. Leaving his rental car in the Rays' driveway, Drum went for a walk to calm his nerves. ","While many people assume sex offenders are incurable, Justice Department statistics show that the overall recidivism rates for sex offenders, including pedophiles, are actually lower than those for other violent crimes. Still, sex offenders are four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime, meaning that the stereotypes we have about them being shadowy characters who continue hurting others sometimes play out as expected. These are the moments that burn in our minds. "," Two major cases surfaced in the first half of March of this year alone. In the first, an Indiana man convicted of multiple violent felonies, including rape, strangled and raped a 17-year-old girl in her apartment. Not long after, a sex offender jailed in California for failing to register (he had been convicted for molesting a minor) was released because of overcrowding. Three days later, he raped and killed his own grandmother. "," In fact, what spurred much of the sex offender registration reform was a crime similar to these—the 1994 murder of 7-year-old Megan Kanka in New Jersey. Megan, who had light brown hair and round cheeks, was lured to a male neighbor's house with a promise that she could see his new puppy. Once she was in his grasp, the neighbor raped Megan and strangled her with a belt. He placed her body into a wooden trunk, assaulting her corpse once more as he did so, before dumping her in a local park. The next day, this man confessed what he had done. He had two previous convictions for sexually assaulting little girls, but had spent less than seven years total in prison. Today, the federal online sex offender registration requirement is often referred to as Megan's Law.                                                             "," These cases are shocking for anyone but, for someone who was sexually abused as a child, hearing about these stories can trigger serious, psychological reactions. ""It is very common that hearing about a child being victimized or hearing about a molester living in the neighborhood would trigger a lot of the old feelings and perhaps memories about what happened to the victim,"" said Dr. Carolyn Knight, professor of social work at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County and the author of Working with Adult Survivors of Childhood Trauma. Some who have experienced abuse in childhood, particularly men, are prone to turning these emotions outward, sometimes violently. ""Physically targeting child molesters is probably very, very rare and unusual,"" Knight said. ""But the dynamic is not uncommon."" ","Drum wandered outside until dawn, collecting his thoughts before he walked back to the Ray home. Drum had read that people were in their deepest sleep then, and figured it would be the easiest time to attack. On the front porch for the second time, Drum slammed the front door in and charged through the living room, past Tweety screeching madly in his cage, down the hall decorated with family photos to meet Jerry Ray, who had emerged from his room because of the commotion. "," ""What's going on?"" Jerry Ray said. Drum fired his pistol and hit Ray in the stomach. Ray stumbled back and tried to dash back into his room and toward the dresser. Whether he was trying to get to a gun or make it to his bedroom window, he couldn't escape in time. Bang, Drum hit him in the back. Ray dropped to the floor. Bang, Drum hit him again. The only sound Jerry Ray made as he crumbled to the ground was a short, ""Ahh."" "," Paul Ray was asleep in a nearby room when his son was shot. He would have gotten up, he said, but he thought the noise was just the sound of the dogs playing in the hall and slamming into his door, which they often did. ", Drum left a note and lollipop identical to the one by Blanton's body in the family's mailbox.                                                             ," After killing Jerry Ray, Drum ditched his rental car in the woods and took to his route by foot. He hitched a ride with a trucker heading toward Blue Mountain Road, which begins at Highway 101 and winds up toward the Olympic Mountain range. There are few homes along this route and Drum hoped to make it to a cleared trail under a strip of power lines that would take him to Quilecene, where his next target lived. ","The intersection of Rte. 101 and Blue Mountain Road, looking toward the Olympic Mountains                                            Google Street View                                    Little did Drum know, Paul Ray had found his son and contacted the police. Checkpoints had been deployed along a number of streets, including Blue Mountain Road, to ask drivers if they had seen a suspicious person. When Drum saw patrol ahead, he told the driver to pull over and bolted into the forest. It was that driver who tipped off the police that Drum was in their midst. "," Soon, about 65 cops and Border Patrol officers were deployed for the manhunt. "," The plan was to flush Drum out of the woods by boxing him in and giving him two choices: flee to the mountains where there were no roads to travel by and where he couldn't hurt anyone, or fall into their grasp. "," Drum tried to stay hidden, but a homeowner saw him pass by and notified the police. A half hour later, a Border Patrol agent spotted Drum near a driveway. A small group of cops chased and tackled him. "," Later, Drum admitted that his plan had been to live in the wild and continue attacking sex offenders as long as he could manage. ""I was going to have no communication with the grid—no informants to worry about and nothing to trace to a network,"" he wrote in a letter. ""For food, I intended on hitting the farm fields [where I had worked] at night. Spring and summer is the easiest time for such a life. I knew I could survive early fall. Late fall and winter, if still free, I would have holed up in a secluded abandoned house."" ","Drum's arrest in Port Angeles, Washington, on June 3, 2012                                            Clallam County Sheriff's Office                                    As the cops led Drum toward the squad cars on Blue Mountain Road, Drum turned to them and commended them on a job well done. He didn't think they'd catch him so quickly. Clallam County Sergeant Nick Turner said Drum walked with a swagger, as if he expected to be caught. As if he was proud of what he'd done. Yet, when Drum was taken down to the station, he said killing was not like he had expected, adding that it doesn't happen easily like it does on television. "," Although Drum initially asked to represent himself in court, he ultimately decided to plead guilty and forego a trial. He said he came to the realization that it would be a waste of tax dollars. "," Prosecutor Kelly considered trying Drum for the death penalty, but changed her mind. When later asked why, Kelly said there were two factors. For one, he had unusual support both in the county and online. She doubted that she could convince 12 jurors to give Drum a death sentence. Sex offenders are not the easiest to empathize with, even if they've been murdered in cold blood. The other factor was Drum's history of drug abuse. The immediate effects of toluene are depressant or excitatory, but the long-term effects include paranoid psychosis, hallucinations and damage to the brain. Drum's history of toluene abuse might have impacted his decision-making skills, Kelly said. And, although he claimed he was clean and only had a single beer on the night of the murders, blood work showed Drum had toluene in his system, which meant that he was using within a couple weeks of the crimes. ","Drum's childhood in Port Angeles and, briefly, in Northern California was far from idyllic. His parents, both drug addicts, had him about one year after their two other sons were put into foster care, and divorced soon thereafter. His father, violent and only sporadically mentally present due to his drug and alcohol use, remarried. As a kid, Drum remembers stealing his father's toluene—a solvent that Drum's mother had abused while Drum was in utero—sparking an addiction that he would struggle with throughout the rest of his life. "," Drum learned quickly that adults, particularly men, could not be trusted. His brother, Isaac, told police that his father was volatile, but Drum later revealed more about the violence in the household. He recalls his father spitting tobacco in his face for doing something wrong, and also strangling him unconscious in front of friends. He remembers what it was like to have adults watch as he writhed on the floor, doing nothing to save him. The memories of seeing the sexual abuse are hazy, but Drum can still recall the night when he was 6 years old and walked into the living room. He remembers that his father was sitting on the couch in a night robe. And he remembers seeing a teenage girl, dressed in a long nightgown, straddling his father and, even then, knowing what he was seeing was wrong. Drum's father was later convicted of statutory rape. "," And later, after the trial and the media deluge, Drum revealed a long-kept secret during a phone interview. "," Drum spent time in the care of other family members and, when he was 10 or 11, was staying with one of his uncles. Drum decided to go for a walk around town by himself. He was coming of age and was enjoying the freedom to do things independently. But, while he was out, a man in his 30s saw him and asked if Drum would like to go drinking. When Drum accepted, the man went to a nearby liquor store and bought two big bottles of whiskey. "," The pair went into the woods and, by the time things started to get out of hand, Drum was too drunk to run away or even really know what was happening. The man forced Drum to perform oral sex and then forced oral sex on him. Drum didn't know where the man went afterward, only that he left. He managed to find his way out of the woods and to the bus line that would take him near his uncle's home. Drunk and unable to walk, he crawled on hands and knees toward the home. Someone in a car saw him and took him the rest of the way.                                                             "," Drum never spoke of what happened that day. He told a few close friends that he had been molested as a child, but nothing more. After the assault, Drum became very protective of others, mostly women and children, almost to a fault. Once, when Drum was a teenager, a girl from out of town started talking smack about Port Angeles at a party. When the other partygoers threw beer cans at her, Drum pulled out a knife and threatened everyone there. "," Through all the times Drum struggled with addiction and was apprehended by the law, he doesn't remember anyone asking him much about why he found it so difficult to hold down a normal life. No one in his family talked about what his father did to that young woman and no one pushed Drum to acknowledge his molestation—his family never suspected it. Even if his family had addressed these problems, he doubts he would have talked to them about it much. "," ""I stonewalled people all the time growing up,"" Drum said. ""I'm a private person…most of my girlfriends would never even know about my dad."" "," He tried to ignore most of what he had seen and experienced, and many people around him attributed his criminal behavior to his drug use. The courts recommended that he to go through some addiction treatment, but never followed up on it. He was never forced to have a psychiatric evaluation or to go to therapy. No one helped him confront his past. This lack of support is incredibly common. ""I can count on my one hand the number of times I've worked with clients where the families have been supportive of them,"" Knight said. ""The typical way is to deny, deny, deny."" "," Of course, most people who are sexually abused as children don't go on to kill pedophiles, and many are not violent. But Drum—with his history of sexual abuse, lack of counseling, and protective nature—was a ticking time bomb.                                                             "," Knight has had clients who, as adults, fantasize about killing the person who sexually assaulted them. She even had a client who went to his perpetrator's home with murderous intentions. (""Luckily the perpetrator didn't answer the door,"" she said. ""I think if he had, he probably would have shot him."") But, often, it's not the assailants that victims are most angry with—it's those who stood by and did nothing. "," Drum's actions, in many ways, were making up for the inactions of others, be it those who watched him struggle as his father abused him or those who never caught his molester and brought him to justice. ""In a way, he's over identified with the children,"" Knight said of Jerry Ray's victims that Drum knew and of the others he wanted to protect, ""and stepping in where nobody stepped in for him."" "," Some called Drum a hero. But if anyone needed a hero to step in and save him, it was Drum himself. "," In the early 2000s, both of Drum's parents died from complications from toluene abuse. Just a couple of years later, Drum heard about the sexually motivated murder of a girl named Melissa Carter in Port Angeles. Her decomposing body was found in a hollow near a popular trail the day after Christmas in 2004. Police believed she was raped and then strangled to death. It was at that moment that Drum decided he was going to kill sex offenders. Not long after, having been arrested and convicted of burglary, Drum met Michael Anthony Mullen. In the summer of 2005, Mullen, dressed in a blue jumpsuit and FBI hat, went to the Bellingham home of three convicted child molesters. He said he was there to warn them of a vigilante who was preying on sex offenders. Accustomed to routine check-ins from police, the men were not suspicious. Mullen chatted them up and bought a six-pack of beer so they could all drink and smoke Camels on the patio together. Around 9 p.m., one of the offenders left for work. When he returned later in the evening, he discovered that his two housemates had been shot and killed. Mullen later said that the man who left showed remorse for his crimes, while the other two did not. About a week after the murders, Mullen turned himself in. "," ""In time, we began formulating a plan to initiate upon my release,"" Drum wrote. ""I was going to smuggle poisons to Mr. Mullen so he could silently eliminate sex offenders in prison. I began talking to other prisoners about how to obtain cyanide, how to produce ricin, and how to obtain or produce nicotine sulfate.""                                                             "," Mullen died—the official cause of death listed as pneumonia, despite investigators' original suspicions of suicide—before the two could act on their plan. But Drum felt empowered about his decision to kill sex offenders and soon he was released from jail. "," When I asked Drum about his motivations, he insisted that what he did was for the betterment of the community. He said his decision to kill Blanton was as much about the pending child abuse case as it was about his sex offender status. He didn't think of himself as much different than a soldier killing insurgents abroad for a cause. ""I believe my experiences with sex offenders, my father and abuse gave me firsthand empathy for the issue, but my actions were not about me,"" he wrote to me in a letter. ""They were about my community. I suffered many failures and my overall view of things was one of hopelessness. I took that hopelessness and in turn threw myself away to a purpose. I gave myself to something bigger than myself."" "," But, as we spoke on the phone, I listened to Drum describe his father and then Blanton. The similarities were striking between them—two men accused of crimes involving young women who had histories of violence and child abuse. I asked Drum if he saw aspects of his father in Blanton. "," ""Yes,"" he said. ""I definitely see aspects of him in Gary."" ","About a week after his sentencing, Drum stabbed a fellow inmate with a sharpened, plastic utensil. The 19-year-old sex offender, who survived the attack, was serving time for failing to register. Drum wouldn't know until later that his victim had committed his sex offense when he was just 13 years old. Drum was soon moved to solitary. When he was released into the general population months later, he fashioned a shiv from a toothbrush and a razor blade and tried to kill another sex offender in the gymnasium. Prison officers caught him before he was able to seriously harm the man, who Drum said had raped a male friend from Port Angeles. And, with that, he was back in solitary indefinitely.                                                             "," Six months after the murders, the cottage in Sequim that Drum and Gary Blanton briefly shared was empty. Inside, the house was torn apart, prepared for remodeling or demolition. The front yard was overgrown with weeds and thin stubs of grass. The only signs of what happened that summer were the bits of red police tape stuck to the padlocks on the front and side doors. "," Next door, a kayak rental store continued to do business. Across the street, small birds flitted around a feeder. Workers down the road at Nash's Organic Grocery tended to the fields, as Drum once did. ","Drum is not happy to be in prison, but he seems to feel at peace with his choices. He has heard of some murderers, like Gary Ridgway the Green River Killer, who get piles of fan mail, but he only receives about one letter a week, and it is never from a fan. He works out and reads a lot. He has begun collecting information about alternative sex offender sentencing that allows offenders to be released faster if they undergo treatment—which he believes helped knock off a significant portion of the time Jerry Ray spent in prison—in hopes that he can find someone to advocate against it on the outside. Anytime he leaves his cell, his legs and arms are shackled. "," He doesn't think much about his past, although he admits that the man who assaulted him when he was a boy would have made the hit list he carried with him as he killed Blanton and Ray. But Drum's feelings about his father are a bit more complicated. If he hadn't been his father, he would have certainly made the list, but Drum isn't particularly comfortable with the idea of patricide. "," What if someone else had killed his father? Drum doesn't hesitate. ""I think he did things that deserved—that merited—death,"" he says. ""I think he deserved that. I think somebody should have.""

"Joe Setyon|Sep. 5, 2018 2:50 pm","Martin Brayley/Dreamstime.comA Cincinnati cop failed to follow department policy when he tased an 11-year-old girl for shoplifting last month, police investigators say.","As Reason reported last month, Brown was off-duty and working security at a Kroger on August 6 when he investigated three girls believed to be shoplifting. According to a police use of force review, he told one of the girls, 11-year-old Donesha Gowdy, to stop and show her receipt, but she wouldn't listen. Gowdy exited the store, at which point Brown tased her from roughly 10 feet away.","The tasing itself wasn't caught on Brown's body camera, but he turned it on soon after. Then he took Gowdy into the Kroger manager's office. ""Sweetheart, the last thing I want to do is tase you like that. When I say stop, you stop. You know you're caught. Just stop. That hurt my heart to do that to you,"" Brown can be heard telling Gowdy. ""You broke the law, and you fled as I tried to apprehend you.""","He adds: ""You know what, Sweetheart, this is why there aren't any grocery stores in the black community."" Brown and Gowdy are both black.",,Additional body camera footage shows Gowdy crying as firefighters remove the taser barbs from her body.,"Gowdy was eventually taken into custody on charges of theft and obstruction of official business. According to the use of force review, she was accused of stealing $53.81 worth of merchandise, including a backpack, clothing, and drinks. The charges have since been dropped.",But Brown is in hot water. The Cincinnati Enquirer summed up the four department policies he's accused of breaking:,The [grocery stores] comment constituted prejudice.,He did not turn on his body camera until after he deployed his Taser.,"He did not warn the girl he was going to use his Taser. He told her to stop three times as she was exiting the store, but did not warn that he was going to escalate his use of force.",The incident wasn't serious enough to deploy a Taser. Police investigators said officers should use the least amount of force necessary when dealing with juveniles.,"The Cincinnati Police Department's use of force policies aren't great to begin with. As the Enquirer notes, officers are allowed to tase suspects as young as 7 and as old as 70. But Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac has defended the use of force policies. ""There may be some areas in which we can tweak,"" he told the Cincinnati City Council's Law and Public Safety Committee yesterday, ""but I believe we do have a very solid policy around our use of force.""","This isn't the first time Brown has gotten in trouble with the department. Last year he was written up for using a homophobic slur to describe an alleged domestic violence victim. It's not clear what his punishment will be this time around. That's up to Isaac, who will make a decision after Brown gets an internal hearing.",Photo Credit: Martin Brayley/Dreamstime.com,Joe Setyon is an assistant editor at Reason.,Joe Setyon is an assistant editor at Reason.,"

"
2018 Cato Institute Surveillance Conference
","Stark racial and partisan divides in favorability toward
police, but no group is “anti-cop”","While
68% of white Americans have a favorable view of the police, only
40% of African Americans and 59% of Hispanics have a favorable
view.1 Attitudes have changed little since the
1970s when 67% of whites and 43% of blacks reported favorable views
of the police. 2 Racial minorities do not have
monolithic attitudes toward the police. This report finds that
Hispanics’ perceptions of police occupy a “middle ground” between
black and white Americans’ views.","Republicans (81%) are far more favorable toward the police than
independents (59%) and Democrats (59%). Nevertheless, majorities of
all three groups share a favorable view.","Furthermore, it’s hard to argue that any group is “anti-cop”
since no group wishes to cut the number of police officers in their
communities (9 in 10 oppose) and majorities are sympathetic toward
the difficulty of police work.4 About 6 in 10 believe
officers have “very dangerous” jobs. However, these groups diverge
widely on whether Americans show enough respect for officers these
days-64% of whites, 45% of Hispanics, and 34% of blacks say
Americans don’t show enough.","Perceptions of how the police do their jobs vary widely
by race and partisanship","Reported experiences with police vary by race and
ethnicity","Most
Americans have had positive experiences with the police but those
who have experienced verbal and physical misconduct are
disproportionately black and Hispanic.","Americans do not believe the US justice system treats
everyone equally","Nearly two-thirds (65%) say police commonly “stop motorists and
pedestrians of certain racial or ethnic backgrounds because the
officer believes that these groups are more likely than others to
commit certain types of crimes.” Another 63% also oppose police
using racial profiling for traffic and pedestrian stops.","Majorities of whites (62%), Hispanics (62%), and blacks (77%)
oppose racial profiling by police. Republicans stand out with a
slim majority (51%) in favor of racial profiling and 49% opposed.
Black Republicans, however, disagree, with 65% who oppose racial
profiling and 35% who support it.5","Results from an experiment embedded in the survey reveal that
liberals are more likely than conservatives to support criminal
justice reform when primed to consider charges of racial bias in
the system. Such charges have little impact on conservatives’
support for reform.","Only
42% of Americans say the US justice system treats all racial groups
equally. A plurality (45%) says the US justice system gives
preference to white Americans, and 13% say the system treats blacks
and Hispanics better. About half of whites (49%) say the justice
system treats all racial groups equally, compared to 17% of African
Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans. White Republicans stand
out with a solid majority (65%) who say the justice system treats
everyone the same; however, only about a third of non-white
Republicans agree. Seven in 10 white and non-white Democrats alike
believe the system is biased in favor of whites.","White Americans are more likely to believe accounts of racial
bias in the system if they are predisposed toward empathy.
Respondents who score high on the Sensitivity to Harm Index (SHI)
are more than twice as likely to believe racial bias plagues the
criminal justice system than those who score low (62% vs.
28%).6","Most
Americans agree about top priorities for the police","Although Americans have different perceptions about how the
police actually do their jobs, majorities of black, white,
and Hispanic Americans agree on what the top three priorities for
the police should be: investigating violent crime (78%), protecting
citizens from crime (64%), and investigating property crime
(58%).","Majorities across racial and ethnic groups agree on path
toward reform","Majorities across racial and ethnic groups also oppose a
variety of actual and alleged police practices:","Six in 10 Americans (59%) support police using drones,
but a majority (54%) also worry drones could invade people’s
privacy","Americans across demographic and political groups support police
use of drones. However, Democrats and independents (57%) are more
wary than Republicans (46%) about the risks drones present to
privacy.","Americans want police to get warrants before conducting
searches of cars and houses and before monitoring phone
calls","Americans agree that even if a person is suspected of breaking
the law, police should obtain a court order before searching
suspected drug dealers’ homes (66%) and before monitoring suspected
criminals’ phone calls (76%). A majority (63%) also oppose police
regularly checking cars for drugs during routine traffic stops
without a court order.","However, Americans might be willing to bend the rules depending
on the suspect. While 66% say police ought to obtain a court order
before searching the home of a suspected drug dealer, only 51% feel
the same for individuals who “might be sympathetic to terrorists”-a
15 point difference. Forty-nine percent (49%) say police shouldn’t
need a court order to search the home of a person the police think
“might” be sympathetic to terrorists.7","Respect for Authority Figures Informs Public Attitudes
Toward Police","Many
American conservatives have a greater respect for authority that
may predispose them to hold more positive views of the police.
Americans who score high on our Respect for Authority Index (RAI)
(who also happen to be disproportionately conservative) are much
more likely than those who score low to favor pedestrian stops (87%
vs. 43%), to favor police using drones (71% vs. 46%), to say police
only use lethal force when necessary (69% vs. 41%), and to say
there is a war on police (77% vs. 42%).8 Statistical
tests indicate that being conservative predicts attitudes toward
the police much more than being liberal.","Changes in socioeconomic status or partisanship do
little to change African Americans’ perceptions of law
enforcement","White
Republicans and whites with higher incomes report more favorable
attitudes toward the police than white Democrats and whites with
lower incomes. However, blacks who are Republican or have higher
incomes are not much more likely to report favorable attitudes
toward the police than blacks who are Democratic or have lower
incomes. 9 Thus, race appears to affect views of
the police even after considering the influence of income and
ideology.","These data provide some indication that if whites become
wealthier and more Republican they become more favorable toward the
police; however, African Americans do not become more favorable
toward the police if their income rises or they become more
Republican.","60% say it’s more important to protect the innocent than
punish the guilty","When asked which would be worse, 60% say it would be worse to
imprison 20,000 innocent people, while 40% say it would be worse to
have 20,000 guilty people who are free.","Majorities of Republicans (55%), independents (60%), and
Democrats (64%) all agree it’s worse to imprison innocent people.
However, Donald Trump’s early supporters stand out with a majority
(52%) who say it’s actually worse to not punish the guilty. Other
Republican voters disagree. For instance 65% of Ted Cruz’s early
supporters say it’s worse to imprison the innocent.10","61% say there is a “War on Police” in
America","At first glance, most Americans (64%) have favorable attitudes
toward their local police department and are confident their local
police use the appropriate amount of force (58%), are courteous
(57%) and honest (57%), treat all racial groups equally (56%),
protect people from violent crime (56%), respond quickly to a call
for help (56%), and care about community members (55%).","Furthermore, 65% of Americans worry that police officers have
“very dangerous jobs,” and 58% feel officers too often must deal
with recalcitrant citizens who don’t show enough respect. Since
many Americans don’t perceive systemic problems in policing, they
view intensifying criticism of policing practices as an attack on
police: 61% of Americans think there is a “war on police”
today.","Attitudes toward the police vary across four ideological
groups of Americans: Libertarians, Liberals, Conservatives, and
Communitarians","To improve upon ideological self-identification (i.e.
liberal/conservative) this report uses answers to a three-question
screen (found in Appendix A) about the role of government in
economic and personal affairs to identify four primary groups of
Americans: Liberals (18%) who favor a larger government that
doesn’t promote traditional values, Libertarians (17%) who favor a
smaller government that doesn’t promote traditional values,
Communitarians (16%) who favor a larger government that promotes
traditional values, and Conservatives (26%) who favor a smaller
government that promotes traditional values. (Another 25% do not
fit in any of these categories). This report also examines how
these four ideological clusters perceive policing in America
today.","At
first glance Americans seem generally satisfied with their local
law enforcement. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Americans have a
favorable view of the police in their communities, including 33%
who have a “very favorable” and 31% who have a “somewhat favorable”
view. Only 14% say they have an unfavorable view of their local
police, and another 22% say they have neither positive nor negative
feelings. (See Appendix B for citizen evaluations of police.)","These topline numbers, however, conceal stark differences in
attitudes toward the police across race/ethnicity, age, education,
income, and ideology. While some groups have firmly positive views
of the police, others believe policing suffers from systematic
problems.","Although 64% of Americans overall have a favorable opinion of
their local police, only 40% of black Americans and 59% of Hispanic
Americans agree. In contrast, white Americans have a much more
favorable (68%) perception of the police in their communities. This
striking divide across racial and ethnic groups’ attitudes toward
the police particularly merits additional investigation.","Millennials
(Americans under 35) (53%), lower income households (<$30,000),
and high school graduates (59%) are also about 20 points less
favorable toward the police than Americans over 65 (82%), middle
and higher income households ($50,000+) (76%), and high school
graduates (73%).11 Suburban residents are only slightly
more favorable toward the police (69%) than urban residents (60%).
Notably, men and women have similar views of the police. (See
Appendix C for breakdown of attitudes by demographics.)","Partisanship significantly correlates with attitudes toward the
police. Republicans are more than 20 points more favorable toward
the police (81%) than Democrats (59%) and independents (59%).
Similarly, ideological Conservatives stand out as the group most
favorable (80%) toward the police. Libertarians’ views (64%) are
more similar to Communitarians’ (58%) and Liberals’ (54%). (See
Appendix A for definitions of ideological clusters.)","Although some groups have less favorable attitudes toward the
police, additional findings in the survey suggest these groups are
not “anti-cop.”  First, few individuals have outright “unfavorable”
views of the police. Only, 12% of Hispanics, 13% of whites, and 19%
of African-Americans have an “unfavorable” view. Instead, African
Americans (40%) and Hispanics (28%) are more likely than whites
(18%) to feel conflicted and report neutral rather than positive or
negative feelings toward the police.","In addition, majorities agree on what law enforcement’s top
priorities ought to be: investigating violent and property crime
and protecting people from crime. Furthermore, being “anti-cop”
should lead a person to want fewer police in a community.  But no group
wishes to decrease the number of police officers in their
communities (about 9 in 10 oppose). Instead, about half of blacks,
whites, and Hispanics favor maintaining present levels and more
than a third say their community needs more officers.","These confidence gaps come with consequences. Effective policing
depends on police and their communities working together in a
symbiotic relationship based on mutual respect and trust. The
police are best able to serve and protect their communities when
the residents freely cooperate with the police, for instance when
residents are willing to report a crime they witness.","However, individuals who have less favorable opinions of the
police are less likely to report a crime. For instance, while 78%
of white Americans say they would “definitely” report a violent
crime they witnessed, considerably fewer African Americans (54%)
and Hispanics (57%) feel as confident. Fewer than half of African
American men with annual incomes less than $30,000 a year would
“definitely” report a crime.","Young Americans are also less likely to say they would report a
violent crime if they saw one compared to seniors (87% vs. 53%). In
addition, households making less than $30,000 a year (62%) and high
school graduates (68%) are considerably less likely than those
making over $60,000 a year (79%) or college graduates (81%) to be
confident they would report a violent crime they witnessed.","When residents feel the justice system is fair and impartial,
they have confidence in the police. Such confidence encourages
cooperation with the police, which is necessary to reduce
crime.14 Moreover, when the police have
legitimacy, the law has legitimacy, which encourages compliance
with the law. Studies have shown that citizens are more likely to
obey the law when the police have legitimacy.15","In communities that distrust local law enforcement, police
departments should seek to earn the trust and confidence of
community members. This will bolster the law’s legitimacy and help
officers do their jobs effectively and safely.","In
order to rebuild trust and confidence in law enforcement, we must
first understand what is driving these disparate attitudes toward
police. The use of public opinion surveys can help to uncover not
only what people think about the police but also to understand
whythey think what they do. This can enable police departments and
lawmakers to craft policies to improve police-community
relations.","The Race Gap This report focuses on racial gaps
in views of the police and does so for several reasons.","First, race and ethnicity are associated with sharp differences
in favorability toward the police (see Appendix C). Moreover,
public opinion studies of the police have long found that race
strongly predicts attitudes toward the police.16","Age, income, and education can change, but the race and
ethnicity of individuals persists. Thus, racial gaps in views of
the police are more durable over time.","Surveys
indicate that the racial divide on policing has not changed much
over the past 50 years. In 1970 a national poll found 67% of white
Americans and 43% of African Americans had a favorable view of the
police.17 Similarly today, 68% of whites and
40% of blacks have a favorable view of the police. This suggests
police reforms implemented since the 1970s have done little to
close the confidence gap.","Race appears to affect views of the police even after
considering the effects of other demographic factors. For instance,
whites making more than $60,000 a year (79%) are more than 20
points more likely than whites making less than $30,000 (56%) a
year to have a favorable view of the police. However, higher income
African Americans (48%) are not much more likely than lower income
African Americans (41%) to have positive views of the police.","A similar pattern emerges across partisans. White Republicans
(83%) are nearly 20 points more likely than white Democrats to feel
favorable toward the police. However, black Republicans (44%) are
no more likely than black Democrats (44%) to have a favorable view.

Thus race appears to affect attitudes toward the police even after
considering the influence of income and ideology.19","Despite the fact that Hispanics comprise 17.4% of the US
population, little research has examined the similarities and
differences in attitudes between Hispanics and other
groups.20 The little research that does exist
suggests Hispanics may take a “middle ground” between white and
black Americans in their attitudes toward the police and thus
should not be combined with other groups. 21 Our data also
indicate that Hispanic attitudes are distinct from blacks’ and
whites’.","This report carefully examines the racial gap in views of the
police and makes efforts to identify potential causes. To assist in
this endeavor, the survey included oversamples of African Americans
and Hispanics (see Survey Methodology Section). Results are
weighted to be representative of the national sample.","In the next section, the report explores a variety of Americans’
perceptions, experiences, and beliefs about law enforcement that
may impact overall favorability toward the police. Next it examines
which of these perceptions and experiences best predicts
favorability toward the police. Lastly, the report investigates
public support for a variety of reforms and policy changes proposed
in recent years to improve police-community relations.","This section examines Americans’ beliefs, perceptions, and
experiences that may impact their general favorability toward the
police, including anxiety about crime in one’s neighborhood,
respect for authority figures, preferences about police priorities,
experiences with the police and perceptions of police competency,
professionalism, impartiality, use of force, accountability and
integrity. It then examines the extent to which each may correlate
with favorability toward the police.","22
Despite falling crime rates nationally, some surveys show Americans
continue to believe crime is getting worse each year. For instance,
Gallup found about two-thirds of Americans say there is more crime
in the United States today that there was a year ago, and that this
share has increased over time. Even at a local level, about half of
Americans say there is “more crime” in their area than there was a
year ago. However, although Americans may say crime is higher, this
report shows they are less concerned about being a crime victim
than in the past, which reflects the fact that crime rates are
decreasing. See Justin McCarthy, “Most Americans Still See Crime Up
Over Last Year,” Gallup November 21, 2014, http://www.gallup.com/poll/179546/americans-crime-last-year.aspx.","23

Archive of Criminal Justice Data.","Police
officers have limited time and resources and thus must decide how
to prioritize their duties. Americans generally agree on the top
three priorities for law enforcement: first, investigating violent
crime like murder, assaults, and domestic violence (78%), second,
protecting individuals from violent crime (64%), and third
investigating property crime and robbery (58%).","A little under a third (30%) think police should make enforcing
drug laws a top three priority.","Notably, only 19% say police should make enforcing traffic laws
a top priority. In other words, Americans de-prioritize the task
leading to the most common interaction individuals have with the
police — receiving a traffic ticket.24","Another 18%
think police should prioritize going beyond traditional law
enforcement responsibilities by “providing guidance and social
services to troubled young adults.” And another 12% say police
enforcing public nuisance laws is most important.","Black, white, and Hispanic Americans prioritize the same top
three tasks for law enforcement; however, groups differ in
intensity of support. Perhaps most strikingly, African Americans
and Hispanics (45%) are 18 points less likely than white Americans
(63%) to prioritize the police investigating property crime and
robbery. (Although this difference largely dissipates among
individuals above the median income). African Americans and Latinos
(27%) are also about twice as likely as Caucasians (15%) to say the
police should prioritize “providing guidance and social services to
troubled young adults.”","Despite these modest differences, Americans across partisanship
and demographics generally have similar priorities in mind for law
enforcement. In addition, beliefs about police priorities don’t
vary with favorability toward the police and thus likely have
little impact on attitudes toward law enforcement.",,"Personal interactions with police officers and the criminal
justice system can influence favorability toward law
enforcement.25 The experiences of family members and
friends may also cause a person to “vicariously experience” those
interactions, thereby shaping views of the police.26 In turn,
disparate personal and vicarious experiences with the police may
help explain differences in favorability toward law
enforcement.",Rating Personal Contact,"Sixty-seven percent (67%) of Americans who have had personal
contact with a police officer in the past five years report being
satisfied with their encounter, rating their satisfaction as either
4 or 5 on a scale of 1 to 5.27","African Americans are considerably less likely than whites and
Hispanics to positively rate their personal interactions with
police officers. Seven in 10 white Americans (70%) and Hispanic
Americans (66%) rate their personal police encounters as a 4 or 5,
compared to 50% of African Americans who rate their personal
encounters highly.",,"As a share of all respondents (both those with and without
personal police contact in the past five years) 56% of white
Americans report having had a satisfactory police encounter in the
past five years, as do 38% of African Americans and 51% of
Hispanics.","Partisans evaluated their interactions with the police
differently. Eight in 10 Republicans report being satisfied with
their police encounters over the past five years, compared to six
in 10 Democrats and independents.","Not surprisingly, satisfaction with personal police contact is
highly correlated with favorability toward one’s local police
department. Among those satisfied with personal police contact, 86%
have a favorable opinion of law enforcement. But, among those
dissatisfied with their interactions with police, 61% have an
unfavorable opinion.",Frequency of Police Stops,"Thirty-eight percent (38%) of Americans report they’ve been
officially stopped by a police officer in the past five years: 20%
say they’ve been stopped once, 9% say they’ve been stopped twice,
and another 9% say they’ve been stopped three or more times (August
2016 survey).28",,"Black Americans report being stopped at a higher frequency than
whites and Hispanics. Among blacks, 27% report being stopped two or
more times in the past five years, as do 18% of whites and 13% of
Hispanics. In a similar pattern, 17% of blacks report being stopped
three or more times, compared to 8% of whites and 4% of
Hispanics.","There
is some evidence that black Americans are more likely to be stopped
by police as their income rises than white Americans similarly
situated. A statistical test finds that as blacks’ incomes rise
they are significantly more likely to report being stopped by
police (see Appendix D).29 However, white and Hispanic
Americans are no more likely to report being stopped by police as
their income rises. For instance, blacks with incomes over $50,000
a year (Mean =1.34 stops) report being stopped at about 1.5 times
the rate of whites with incomes over $50,000 a year (Mean =.91
stops). 30 Among those making less than $50,000
annually, blacks’ average number of reported stops (Mean=.84 stops)
is only slightly above whites’ (Mean =.76 stops).","This fits with anecdotal reports from wealthy African Americans
who report they avoid driving expensive cars to avoid added police
scrutiny. For instance, actor Isaiah Washington tweeted that he
sold his Mercedes and bought three less expensive Honda Priuses
because he “got tired of being pulled over by the police.”31 Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and billionaire
private-equity financier Robert Smith have shared similar stories
of being stopped three to seven times a year.32",Types of Personal Contact,"About
a quarter (27%) of Americans report having had an experience in
which a police officer kept them or their family member safe in a
potentially dangerous situation. Such reports do not vary
considerably among demographic and political groups. As one would
expect, individuals who report being kept safe (76%) are about 16
points more likely to report a favorable opinion of the police than
those without this experience (60%).","Most Americans have also personally or vicariously come into
contact with the police and justice system for less auspicious
reasons. About half (47%) say they know someone who has been
stopped and searched by an officer, 63% say they know someone who
has been arrested, and 57% say they know someone who has been in
prison or jail.",,"African Americans (60%) are 13-20 points more likely than
Caucasians (47%) and Hispanic Americans (40%) to know someone who
has been stopped and searched by a police officer. About two-thirds
of blacks and whites say they know someone who has been arrested or
been to prison or jail, compared to 47% of Hispanics.",,"People who report knowing someone who has been stopped and
searched by a police officer are about 14 points less favorable
toward the police (57%) than those who do not know someone with
this experience (71%). However knowing someone who has been
arrested or been to prison or jail doesn’t correlate (either
positively or negatively) with favorability toward the police.",Urban Density,"Whether someone lives in an urban, suburban, or rural area might
influence their attitudes toward the police.33 People who
live in densely populated areas are more likely to come into
contact with officers. City centers also are more likely to have
higher crime rates, which may increase the likelihood one has an
encounter with law enforcement.34 However, actual
differences in favorability toward the police by community type are
rather small. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of individuals living in the
suburbs have a favorable view of the police, as do 60% of those
living in cities and 61% residing in rural areas.","In general, nearly 6 in 10 Americans give their local police
forces high marks for enforcing the law (59%), protecting people
from violent crime (56%) and responding quickly to a call for help
(56%). Slightly fewer (50%) give their local police a high rating
for solving crime.35 However, there are significant
differences across race/ethnicity, ideology, income, and urban
density in perceptions of police competency (see Appendix C).",,"White
Americans are roughly 20 points more likely than African Americans,
and 10-15 points more likely than Hispanic Americans, to highly
rate their local police departments for effectiveness. (See
Appendix C for full breakdowns.) For instance, while 60% of white
Americans think police effectively protect people from crime, only
38% of African Americans and 49% of Hispanics agree. Similarly
about 6 in 10 whites think the police do a good job enforcing the
law and responding quickly, compared to 4 in 10 blacks and less
than half of Latinos.","Perceptions of police competency strongly correlate with
ideology. Seventy-eight percent (78%) of respondents who identify
as “very conservative” gave their local police high ratings for
enforcing the law, while only 46% of “very liberal” respondents
agree. Similarly, while 62% of very conservative respondents have
high confidence in their local police departments’ ability to solve
crime, only 35% of very liberal respondents agree.","Education, income, and age are also related to perceptions of
police efficacy. College graduates (67%), households earning
$60,000+ a year (69%), and seniors (72%) give the police high
ratings for “enforcing the law.” In contrast, considerably fewer
high school graduates (55%), households earning less than $30,000 a
year (54%), and millennials (53%) agree.36 Suburban
residents (62%) are somewhat more likely than urban residents (53%)
to believe the police are effective at enforcing the law.","In sum, Americans who are older, higher income, conservative,
white, and living in the suburbs are the most likely to believe the
police are good at their jobs. Conversely, individuals who are
younger, lower income, liberal, African American or Hispanic, and
living in urban neighborhoods are least confident that the police
are competent. (See Appendix D for full breakdowns.)  ","Evaluations of police competency are highly correlated with
overall favorability toward the police. Among those who give the
police high ratings for protecting people from crime, 83% have a
favorable view of local law enforcement, compared to 27% among
those who have low confidence in police competency.37","Nearly six
in 10 Americans give their local police department high ratings for
“being courteous” (57%) and for demonstrating they care about the
people in the community (55%).38 About 3 in 10 give the
police an average rating and 1 in 10 give police a low rating.
Responses differ by race, age, income, and partisanship.","About 4 in 10 African Americans give their local police
departments high ratings for being courteous and caring about
community members, compared to 6 in 10 white Americans and half of
Hispanics.","Millennials
(45%) and households earning less than $30,000 a year (56%) are
less likely than seniors (73%) and households earning more than
$80,000 annually (64%) to give their police high ratings for
courteousness. Similarly 43% of millennials and 50% of households
earning less than $30,000 a year give the police high marks for
caring about community members, compared to about two-thirds of
seniors (66%) and households making more than $80,000 a year
(61%).","Republicans (7 in 10) are also more likely than Democrats (5 in
10) to highly rate their police departments for being courteous and
caring about the community. Race and ethnicity does not account for
this result. White Republicans (74%) are 24 points more likely than
white Democrats (50%) to give their local police high marks for
being courteous.","Perceptions of police professionalism and empathy are highly
correlated with individuals’ favorability toward the police. Of
those who give their local police high ratings for caring about
community members, 85% have a favorable opinion of the police,
compared to 24% of those who give local police low ratings for
empathy.","About
one in five Americans say a police officer has used profanity with
them (17%) and say they know someone physically mistreated or
abused by the police (21%).39","Reported experience with police mistreatment varies by race,
age, gender, and income. African Americans are about twice as
likely as whites to report profanity or knowing someone physically
mistreated by the police. About a quarter of African Americans
(26%) and Hispanics (22%) report police using abusive language with
them compared to 15% of whites. Nearly 4 in 10 African Americans
(39%) and 27% of Hispanics report knowing someone physically
mistreated by police, compared to 18% of whites.","Men,
millennials, and those making less than 30,000 a year (about a
quarter) are also about 10 points more likely than women, seniors,
and households making over $60,000 a year to report personal or
vicarious experiences with police mistreatment.","An AP/NORC survey conducted in 2015 found that 57% of Americans
thought that citizens’ failure to cooperate with police during a
stop was a “major reason” for police use of force.40 Some
readers may wonder if police swearing occurs when citizens are
uncooperative and disrespectful. Perhaps those inclined to respect
authority defer to police and are thus less likely to incur verbal
abuse.","To investigate, the author created a Respect for Authority Index
(RAI), a composite scale based on averaging responses to three
questions that measured people’s general respect for authority
without explicitly asking about police. (See Appendix E for
question wording.) A higher RAI score indicates a respondent is
more apt to respect authority figures. Higher RAI scores are not
direct measures of deference to the police, but rather indicate a
higher likelihood of deference.","Individuals
with a higher RAI score are less likely to report police swearing
at them; however, this finding primarily holds for white Americans.
Among whites, those with low RAI scores are 3 times as likely as
whites with high RAI scores to report experience with police
profanity — 27% vs. 9%.41 In contrast, African
Americans and Hispanics with lower RAI scores are not that much
more likely than those with higher RAI scores to say they’ve
experience police profanity.","This gives some indication that whites who are highly
deferential toward the police may have better experiences, whereas
blacks and Hispanics who are very deferential may not experience
similarly improved treatment.","Unsurprisingly, only 40% of individuals who have personally or
vicariously experienced verbal or physical abuse from officers have
a favorable view of the police compared to 70% among those without
these negative experiences. In sum, abuse at the hands of an
individual police officer — whether individually or
vicariously experienced — may be internalized and help
explain differences in favorability toward the police.","A
belief that police are biased should affect public opinion about
the police. Individuals might see the system as biased in general
but not toward them. Alternatively, they might believe the system
is both biased in general and toward them. This report investigates
both perceptions.","Fully
58% of Americans say the criminal justice system fails to treat all
individuals equally, including 45% who believe the system gives
preference to white Americans and 13% who think the system treats
black and Hispanic Americans better. Less than half (42%) of
Americans believe the justice system is impartial. However, a
majority (56%) give their local police departments high marks for
“treating racial and ethnic groups equally.”42","Perceptions of bias vary widely by race, ethnicity, and
partisanship. About half (49%) of white Americans believe the
criminal justice system treats everyone about the same. Only 17% of
black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans agree. Instead, a
strong majority (72%) of African Americans, a slim majority of
Hispanics (51%), and 40% of Caucasians believe the justice system
gives preferences to whites. About 1 in 10 black and white
Americans and 2 in 10 Hispanic Americans think the justice system
offers greater leniency to minorities.","More
than two-thirds (69%) of Democrats say the system favors whites
over blacks and Hispanics while 21% say the system treats everyone
equally. But, 64% of Republicans say the system treats everyone the
same while 21% think the system is biased in favor of whites.
Independents are divided: 45% think the system is fair, and 41%
think the system gives preference to Caucasians.","Here again, race matters more than partisanship. Although white
Republicans (67%) are 41 points more likely than white Democrats
(26%) to believe the system treats everyone equally, black
Republicans (15%) are about as likely as black Democrats (13%) to
think the system is impartial. Hispanics fall in between, with
Hispanic Republicans 28 points more likely than Hispanic Democrats
to believe the system is fair (45% vs. 17%).43 Ultimately,
white Republicans are the only group that solidly believes the
justice system treats all citizens fairly.","These data indicate partisan ideology is correlated with
perceptions of impartiality in the justice system, but primarily
for whites and Hispanics. Hispanic and white Republicans are both
more likely than Hispanic and white Democrats to believe the system
is fair. However, black Republicans and black Democrats have
similar views about the system’s fairness. Why? African Americans
may have different personal or vicarious experiences with the
police.","Local Police Departments These
confidence gaps extend to evaluations of local police departments.
While 64% of white Americans highly rate their local police for
impartiality, only 31% of African Americans and 42% of Hispanics
agree.44 Republicans (78%) are also
considerably more likely than Democrats (40%) and independents
(57%) to highly rate their local police for impartiality.","Urban
residents (47%) are also less likely than suburban (62%) and rural
residents (59%) to believe the police treat all groups the same.
This pattern generally holds across racial groups: whites living in
suburbs are about 19 points more likely than whites living in
cities to highly rate their local police for impartiality (70% vs.
51%). Suburban Hispanics (54%) are 14 points more likely than
Hispanics living in cities (40%) to agree. Blacks living in cities
are slightly more likely (33%) than blacks living in suburbs (25%)
to highly rate their local police for impartiality.","Belief that one’s local department suffers from racial bias
strongly correlates with favorability toward the police. Among
those who highly rate their department for impartiality, 83% have a
favorable view of the police.45 However, only 31% of
those who are not confident of such impartiality have a favorable
view.","Personal
Bias","Although most Americans believe the justice system suffers from
bias, 75% expect the police will treat them the same as anyone else
for a traffic violation or minor offense. Ten percent (10%) of
Americans think police would treat them worse than other people,
and 15% expect they would be treated better.","Majorities of black (60%), Hispanic (60%), and white (77%)
Americans personally expect to receive equal treatment from police.
However blacks and Hispanics comprise a disproportionate share of
those who expect worse treatment. African Americans (32%) are about
five times more likely, and Hispanics (13%) twice as likely, as
white Americans (6%) to expect worse treatment.","Notably,
although only a third of African Americans and 42% of Hispanics
highly rate their police departments for impartiality, majorities
of both groups (60% and 72% respectively) believe they
personally would be treated the same as other
people.46 This suggests that expectations about
personal treatment are not sufficient to explain perceptions of
bias in the department overall.","Predictably, those who expect to receive equal treatment are
more favorable toward the police than those who expect worse
treatment by a margin of 70% to 29%.","Taking
these results together, Americans are more likely to perceive
racial bias in the criminal justice system overall than at the
level of their local police department. They are least likely to
expect to personally be treated inequitably. Ultimately,
perceptions of systemic bias more strongly and negatively correlate
with favorability toward the police than do personal expectations.
It is important for people to believe the system is fair
— even to other people — for the police to have
legitimacy.","Who Believes Charges of Racial Bias? What might
lead a person to believe disparate treatment exists if one doesn’t
personally experience it? Perhaps an above average concern for
others experiencing harm may lead one to be more apt to believe
charges of racial bias.","To investigate, the author created a Sensitivity to Harm
Index (SHI), based on the Care/Harm Foundation in Moral
Foundations Theory.47 The SHI is a composite scale based on
averaging responses to two questions that measure people’s
sensitivity to others’ suffering, without explicitly asking about
police or race. (See Appendix F for question wording.)For instance,
respondents who strongly agree that “compassion for those who are
suffering is the most crucial virtue” score higher on the SHI
scale. SHI scores do not vary considerably across demographics,
except that women tend to have higher scores than men.","Individuals who score high on the Sensitivity to Harm Index
(SHI) are far more likely to believe racial bias is a problem in
the criminal justice system. For instance, 58% of whites with high
SHI scores believe the justice system is biased against blacks and
Hispanics compared to 27% among those with low scores.48 Whites who score low on SHI are far
more likely to say the system treats everyone the same than those
who score high (58% vs. 36%). These results suggest that people who
tend to empathize may be more sensitive to charges of racial bias
in police encounters.","Nearly
two-thirds (65%) say police commonly “stop motorists and
pedestrians of certain racial or ethnic backgrounds because the
officer believes that these groups are more likely than others to
commit certain types of crimes.” Another 63% also oppose police
using racial profiling for traffic and pedestrian stops.
(Furthermore, 63% of Americans oppose racial profiling).","An overwhelming majority of African Americans (81%) believe the
police regularly racially profile. A majority of Hispanics (70%)
and Caucasians (62%) agree.","Democrats (80%) are considerably more likely than Republicans
(53%) and independents (61%) to believe the police engage in racial
profiling. Ideological Conservatives comprise the only political
group with a majority (54%) who believe racial profiling does
not commonly occur. In contrast, majorities of Liberals
(87%), Communitarians (67%), and Libertarians (63%) think police
routinely racially profile. (See Appendix A for definitions of
ideological clusters.)",Among Whites,Among Blacks,Among Hispanics,"Most Americans think the police typically use appropriate force
for each situation. Nearly two-thirds (63%) say the “tactics used
by police officers” are “about right” while 30% say that they are
too harsh and 7% say they aren’t harsh enough. Most Americans (58%)
also believe that police “only use deadly force when it is
necessary” while 42% think that police are “too quick to use deadly
force.” Thus Americans are slightly more likely to believe police
use lethal force unnecessarily than to believe routine police
tactics are too harsh. Yet, Americans evaluate police tactics
differently across race and ethnicity, income, age, and political
ideology.",,"Six
in 10 African Americans say police tactics are “too harsh” and 7 in
10 say police are too quick to resort to deadly force. In contrast,
7 in 10 whites think that police tactics are appropriate and that
police only use necessary lethal force. Hispanics are in between:
although a majority (54%) say police often unnecessarily resort to
lethal force, a majority (58%) also say routine police tactics are
reasonable.","Millennials are about 20 points more likely than seniors to say
police are too quick to use deadly force (52% vs. 29%) and to think
police tactics are too harsh (38% vs. 16%). White millennials are
largely driving this shift: white millennials are 23 points more
likely than white seniors to believe the police are too quick to
use lethal force (47% vs. 24%). However, Hispanic and black
millennials are about as likely as Hispanic and black seniors to
believe police too often resort to excessive force.","Households
making less than $30,000 a year are also about 11-14 points more
likely than those making more than $60,000 a year to believe that
police too easily resort to lethal force (52% vs. 38%) and that
police use harsh tactics (36% vs. 25%). Whites are primarily
driving this shift by age and income, as African Americans are no
less likely to perceive harsh tactics with increasing age and
income.","Partisans
also disagree. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of Democrats say police are
too quick to use lethal force while 80% of Republicans say police
only use it when necessary. Democrats are also nearly four times as
likely as Republicans to say police tactics are too harsh (40% vs.
11%).","Again, race matters more than partisanship in perceptions of
police use of force. White Republicans are 41 points more likely
than white Democrats to say police only use necessary deadly force
(85% vs. 44%).53 However, black Republicans (36%) are
only 16 points more likely than black Democrats (20%) to agree. In
a similar fashion, Hispanic Republicans are only 16 points more
likely than Hispanic Democrats to believe police only use necessary
force. (58% vs. 42%).","This suggests that political ideology may affect evaluations of
police use of force, though primarily for whites. This is a
familiar pattern found in earlier analyses. White Republicans are
far more likely than white Democrats to have a more positive
opinion of the police; however, black Republicans do not differ
much from black Democrats in their evaluations of police
action.","Americans who score high on the Respect for Authority Index
(RAI) are significantly more likely than those who score low to
believe that police tactics are about right (79% vs. 39%) and to
say that police only use necessary lethal force (69% vs. 41%).
54 (See Appendix E for RAI details.)","Evaluations of police use of force strongly correlate with
favorability toward the police. Eight in 10 have a favorable
opinion of the police among those who believe officers use
appropriate force. Among those who believe police use excessive
force, only four in 10 agree.",Accountability,"Nearly half
of Americans (46%) believe police are not “generally held
accountable for misconduct” when it occurs, while 54% believe they
are. It is remarkable that nearly half believe misconduct
“generally” is not brought to account. This view is held by larger
shares of black and Hispanic Americans, younger people, lower
income individuals, and Democrats.","About two-thirds (64%) of African Americans and 52% of Hispanics
believe police “generally” are not held accountable for misconduct.
In contrast, 57% of white Americans think police are held
accountable.","Confidence in police accountability increases with age and
income. Majorities of seniors (70%) and households earning more
than $80,000 annually (60%) believe police are held accountable. In
contrast, majorities of millennials (58%) and those earning less
than $30,000 a year (54%) doubt police misconduct is punished.","Partisanship
also strongly correlates with confidence in police accountability.
Three-fourths (76%) of Republicans and a slim majority of
independents (51%) believe police are held to account. In contrast,
nearly 6 in 10 Democrats believe officers are not held accountable.
These partisan differences are not merely a function of the
parties’ racial compositions. Sixty-five percent (65%) of white
Democrats also worry officers are not held accountable, compared to
only 26% of white Republicans.","Perceptions of police accountability are highly correlated with
favorability toward the police. Americans who believe the police
are held accountable for misconduct (81%) are 35 points more
favorable toward the police than those who doubt police are brought
account (46%).",,Integrity,"Americans
are also unconvinced that most police officers have integrity.
Nearly half (49%) believe that “most police officers think they are
above the law,” while 51% disagree. Perceptions vary widely across
race and ethnicity, income, and partisanship.","Six in ten African Americans and Hispanics believe officers
think they are above the law. In contrast, a majority (54%) of
white Americans believe police officers don’t think they are above
the law.","Democrats (61%) are also far more concerned than Republicans

$80K+ households (63%) and seniors (68%) believe police follow the
law.","Institutions need legitimacy to function. A belief in the rule
of law (and not individuals) fosters their legitimacy. It is thus
problematic that nearly half of all Americans and majorities of
blacks, Hispanics, young people, Democrats, and lower income
individuals think “most” police officers don’t believe the laws
apply to them.","Social
psychologists have found that respect for authority is a universal
instinctive trait in human psychology.55 As Haidt and
Graham (2007) explain, “People often feel respect, awe, and
admiration toward legitimate authorities, and many cultures have
constructed virtues related to good leadership, which is often
thought to involve magnanimity, fatherliness, and wisdom…[Societies
may also] value virtues related to subordination: respect, duty,
and obedience.”56 While respect for authority figures
is a universal human trait, it is more salient for some.57 These individuals believe strong
authority figures are necessary to maintain social order and
prevent society from devolving into chaos. Might these individuals
be predisposed to have more favorable opinions of the police
irrespective of circumstances?","To
investigate, the author created the Respect for Authority
Index (RAI), a composite scale based on averaging
responses to three questions that measured people’s deference
toward authority, without explicitly asking about police. (See
Appendix E for question wording.) A higher RAI score indicates a
respondent has a higher respect for authority.","Notably, the RAI index does not detect significant differences
by demographic groups, with two exceptions. Forty-two percent (42%)
of Americans over 55 are in the highest RAI quartile compared to
17% among those under 35. Ideological Conservatives (44%) are also
much more likely to score in the highest quartile than Liberals
(16%) and Libertarians (27%).58 Communitarians, who favor
a bigger government that also promotes traditional values, are
similar to Conservatives with 38% scoring in the top quartile.","Respect for authority is correlated with favorability toward the
police. Seventy-nine percent (79%) of those who score in the
highest RAI quartile have a favorable opinion of the police,
compared to 45% among those scoring in the lowest quartile. These
results go beyond partisanship. Democrats who score high on RAI
(71%) are 20 points more likely than Democrats who score low (51%)
to have a favorable opinion of the police.",,"People with a high respect for authority are also far more
likely to support stop-and-frisk-like policies. Eighty-seven
percent (87%) of this group favor allowing police officers to stop
and search people who the officer thinks looks “suspicious or out
of place,” compared to 43% of low RAI scorers. High scorers are
also 40 points more likely than low scorers to believe police use
appropriate force (79% vs. 39%).","Americans who score high on respect for authority are far more
concerned the police are under attack. Among high RAI scorers, 77%
believe there is a “War on Police,” 76% say that Americans show
“too little respect” for police these days, and 86% say that police
officers’ jobs are “very dangerous.” In contrast, low RAI scorers
are about 40 points less likely to believe there is a war on police
(42%), that people aren’t sufficiently deferential (35%), and that
police have very dangerous jobs (43%).","People who highly respect authority figures are far more likely
to believe society will break down if strong institutions do not
regulate conduct. Among this group, 63% believe that violent crime
would “increase a lot” if the government legalized drugs, compared
to only 26% among low RAI scorers. They may also fear that
criticizing the police undermines their legitimacy and thereby
fosters social instability. 59 Thus, reformers may be
more effective by making clear their commitment to support police
work to promote safety, security, order and
justice.","This
section assesses public support for a variety of reforms including
additional police training, police body cameras, civil asset
forfeiture, independent investigations of police misconduct, and
drug de-criminalization. This section also explores public
attitudes towards a variety of possible policing practices
including police use of military weapons, drones, racial profiling,
police stops and searches of pedestrians, cars, houses, and
telephone surveillance. It also examines the extent to which
Americans believe citizens need to show greater respect for the
police during their encounters, irrespective of police reform.","Although Americans disagree about how police do their jobs,
majorities across racial and ethnic groups support a variety of
proposed reforms intended to improve police-community relations,
including:","Similarly, majorities across racial and ethnic groups oppose a
variety of possible police practices including:",,"Americans
believe police officers could do more to deescalate situations.
More than two-thirds (68%) say that “most” police officers “need
additional training on how to handle confrontations with citizens.”
A third (32%) think officers already have sufficient training.","A solid majority of Americans approve of de-escalation training
even though most believe police officers use appropriate force and
have integrity. This implies one does not need to perceive systemic
problems in order to support additional training. Instead, from the
perspective of the average person, additional police training
sounds sensible and useful both for police officers and
citizens.","Majorities across racial groups agree, although African
Americans (82%) and Latinos (78%) are more likely to believe the
police could benefit from further training than Caucasians
(62%).","Half of Republicans (50%) believe “police officers have the
appropriate training needed” already for dealing with
confrontations. In contrast, an overwhelming share of Democrats
(84%) as well as two-thirds (66%) of independents say police could
benefit from further training. It may be that Republicans perceive
calls for additional training as a criticism of police authority.
Advocates might be more effective in persuading Republicans if they
explain how police training improves officer safety.","Police departments throughout the country have begun adopting
new technologies to assist in their police work. Americans support
such efforts, so long as they are convinced the technologies are
necessary and will not invade their privacy.","Almost all
Americans (89%) support requiring police officers to wear body
cameras to record their on-duty interactions: 53% “strongly
support” and 35% “somewhat support” this proposal. A paltry 11%
oppose police wearing body cameras. Support extends across
demographic and political groups. In an era of hyper-partisanship,
police body cameras attract bipartisan approval.","Many police officers have interpreted public support for body
cameras as public censure of the police.66 However,
Americans who have a favorable opinion of the police are as likely
as those with unfavorable views to support police body cameras.","Moreover, most Americans (74%) believe such a policy will
equally protect both the police officers that wear them and the
citizens who interact with the police. Few expect cameras to
exclusively protect citizens (15%) or police officers (11%).","Paying for Body Cameras Raising taxes to pay
for police body cameras enjoys less support. A slim majority (51%)
of Americans say they would pay higher taxes to outfit their local
police department with body cameras, while 49% would not.",">Politics,
rather than demographics, primarily drive attitudes toward tax
increases for body cameras. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of Democrats
and 52% of independents say they’d pay higher taxes for body
cameras, while a majority (62%) of Republicans say they would
not.","Different groups favor body cameras for different reasons. Those
who trust the police may believe cameras protect officers from
frivolous lawsuits or encourage citizens to behave better. Those
distrustful of the police may believe cameras improve officer
behavior and accountability.","Access to Body Camera Footage Although most
Americans agree police should wear body cameras, only a slim
majority (52%) say police officers should be allowed to watch body
camera footage before making their official statements
about violent encounters, while 48% oppose.","A
majority (58%) of those with a favorable opinion of police in
general say officers should be allowed to watch the video footage
before making a statement. Of those with an unfavorable view, a
larger majority (71%) say officers should be denied access to the
footage before giving their official statement.","There are stark racial and political divisions as well. A
majority of whites (57%), independents (52%), and Republicans (63%)
say police should be allowed early access to video footage. In
contrast, majorities of blacks (69%), Hispanics (56%), and
Democrats (58%) oppose early access.","Confidence in the police matters here. Those with greater
confidence trust officers not to use their early access to change
their stories or mislead investigators. Those who lack confidence
may think officers will use early access to absolve themselves from
blame.","A
majority (59%) of Americans support police departments “regularly”
using unmanned aircraft or drones. However, support is “soft:” only
15% strongly support while 44% somewhat support using drones. About
4 in 10 (41%) oppose, including 25% who somewhat oppose and 17% who
strongly oppose police drones.","Nevertheless, a majority (54%) of Americans are concerned police
drones may invade their privacy. Since police drones are new, the
nation has had little debate over their use. People may change
their minds about them as they become more familiar with the
technology and related policy issues.","Demographic
groups don’t vary much in their support for police drones, although
seniors (71%) are more supportive than millennials (54%). Ideology
does matter. Conservatives (63%) and Communitarians (67%) are
considerably more likely than Liberals and Libertarians (50%) to
support police regularly using drones. 67","Respect for authority figures and general trust in the police
likely increases approval of police drones. Americans who score
high on the Respect for Authority Index (RAI) are 25 points more

wary of the risks drones present to privacy than Republicans who
don’t identify with the tea party (46%). Non-tea party Republicans
stand out, with a majority (54%) who say they are not concerned
about police drones. Libertarians (65%) are most concerned about
drones invading privacy, followed by Liberals (58%), and then
Communitarians (47%) and Conservatives (46%).","Young people are more concerned than older people about the
risks of drones. Sixty percent (60%) of millennials are worried
drones may invade people’s privacy while 40% are not. Only 40% of
seniors are concerned about drones and 60% are not.","Americans who score high on the Respect for Authority Index
(RAI) are 19 points less likely than those who score low to be
concerned about drones invading privacy (42% vs. 61%).","Predictably, people who trust the police are less concerned
about them abusing new technology. Drone critics will need to
explain how even a trustworthy police department may overstep its
bounds with drones.","Although
Americans are open to police using new technologies, they are wary
of military equipment. A majority-54%-of Americans says police
using military weapons and armored vehicles is “going too far”
while 46% say these tools are “necessary for law enforcement
purposes.”","Majorities across racial groups oppose police militarization.
Support for police militarization comes from older Americans,
conservative Republicans, and those with high school educations or
less. Americans over 65 years old support police using military
weapons and armored vehicles by a margin of 61% to 39%. However,
support for police militarization declines to 43% among those under
55, with 57% opposed. People with high school degrees or less are
also more supportive (51%) of police militarization compared to
those with college degrees (42%).","Conservatives
and Republicans stand out in supporting police militarization.  A
majority of Republicans (65%) support police using military weapons

independents (60%) oppose. Among ideological groups, Conservatives
(60%) and Communitarians (51%) say police militarization is
necessary today, while strong majorities of Liberals (75%) and
Libertarians (60%) say it goes too far.69","Civil
asset forfeiture is a process by which police officers seize a
person’s property (e.g. their car, home, or cash) if they suspect
the individual or property is involved with criminal activity. The
individual does not need to be charged with, or convicted of, any
crime for police to seize assets.70 In most jurisdictions
police departments may keep the property they seize or the proceeds
from its sale. What do Americans think of civil asset
forfeiture?","Fully 84% of Americans oppose the practice of police taking “a
person’s money or property that is suspected to have been involved
in a drug crime before the person is convicted of a crime.” Only
16% approve.","In instances when police departments seize people’s cars,
houses, or cash, 76% of Americans say local departments should not
be allowed to keep the assets. Instead, 48% say seized assets
should go into the state general fund, while another 28% say assets
should go into a dedicated state-level general law enforcement
fund.","Although Americans prefer policing be done by local (not state
or federal) authorities, only 24% think local police departments
should keep the assets they seize. 71 Americans may
believe transferring seized assets to a state-level fund will
reduce local departments’ material incentive to seize people’s
property.","Opposition
to civil asset forfeiture cuts across demographics and
partisanship. Majorities of whites (84%), blacks (86%), Hispanics
(80%), Democrats (86%), independents (87%), and Republicans (76%)
all oppose. In fact, virtually every major group surveyed solidly
rejects the practice and prefers property only be seized after a
person is convicted of a crime. Even those highly favorable toward
the police staunchly oppose (78%) civil asset forfeiture.","Few understand the concept of civil asset forfeiture. Yet, once
the concept is explained to them in concrete terms the public
overwhelmingly rejects the practice. Thus, reformers’ primary
challenge is informing the public that this practice occurs. Policy
reforms may follow broader public knowledge of civil
forfeiture.","In
most jurisdictions, local police departments typically conduct
internal investigations of police officer misconduct
complaints.72 However, 79% of Americans would
prefer that an “outside law enforcement agency take over the
investigation” when an officer is suspected of criminal wrongdoing.
Alternatively, 21% favor police departments conducting internal
investigations of their own officers.","The proposal to have outside investigations of misconduct enjoys
broad public support. Overwhelming majorities across demographics
and partisan groups, including majorities of blacks (82%), whites
(81%), Hispanics (66%), Democrats (83%), independents (77%), and
Republicans (76%), all favor outside investigations and
prosecutions of officers accused of misconduct.","The police traffic stop is the most common form of contact
citizens have with police officers.83 If the
officer has probable cause, she may also search a person’s vehicle.
Officers may also stop and in some cases search pedestrians, if the
officer reasonably suspects the person has committed or is about to
commit a crime.84 Police may also indirectly interact
with individuals who are criminal suspects when conducting a search
of their home or when monitoring their phone calls, with a court
order.85 This next section explores public
attitudes about a variety of possible police practices regarding
police stops and searches of pedestrians, cars, houses, and
attitudes toward police surveillance."," When
it comes to traffic and pedestrian stops, Americans solidly oppose
police using someone’s race as a factor in deciding whom to
stop.","Two-thirds
(63%) of Americans oppose police officers “stopping motorists or
pedestrians of certain racial or ethnic groups because the officer
believes that these groups are more likely than others to commit
certain types of crimes.” This percentage includes 34% who strongly
oppose and 29% who somewhat oppose this practice. The remaining
third (37%) support racial profiling, including 10% who strongly
support and 26% who somewhat support it. Despite strong public
opposition, fully 65% of Americans also believe police regularly
use racial profiling for traffic and pedestrian stops.","
Oddly, among Americans who believe the U.S. justice system treats
all groups equally, nearly half also concede that police commonly
racially profile people.  Thus some Americans may continue to
insist the system treats everyone impartially even though they
believe police engage in racial profiling. This indicates that some
believe racial profiling is consistent with a fair justice
system.","African Americans are the most opposed to racial profiling
(77%), although majorities of both Latinos (62%) and whites (62%)
also oppose. Black Americans are also nearly twice as likely to
“strongly oppose” (56%) profiling as Latinos and whites (31%).
Latinos and Caucasians are not significantly different in their
support for racial profiling.","Partisans
see profiling differently. A strong majority (73%) of Democrats and
independents (64%) oppose it while roughly 3 in 10 support its use.
In contrast, a slim majority (51%) of Republicans support racial
profiling while nearly as many (49%) oppose. However, Black
Republicans differ from their fellow partisans: 65% oppose racial
profiling and 35% support it.86 Hispanic Republicans also
oppose by a margin of 57% to 43%.","In addition, although all age groups oppose racial profiling,
millennials (69%) are more opposed than seniors (54%).","People who strongly support racial profiling are more likely to
prioritize punishing guilt than protecting innocence. Among those
who strongly favor police racial profiling, a majority (53%) say it
would be worse to allow 20,000 guilty people go free rather than
wrongly imprison 20,000 innocent people. Conversely, among those
who strongly oppose racial profiling, 69% say it would be worse to
imprison 20,000 innocent people than to allow 20,000 guilty people
go unpunished. (Also see Blackstone’s Ratio: Is it More Important
to Protect Innocence or Punish Guilt.)","The
law often requires citizens to comply with police during official
police “stops” or justified searches of a person or their property.
But not all interactions constitute official police stops, and
citizens may refuse some searches. However, most jurisdictions do
not require officers to inform citizens of their right to decline.
Do Americans think police officers should be required to tell
citizens when they are not being officially detained and when
searches are voluntary? Yes.","A strong majority (73%) of Americans would support a law to
require officers to tell citizens if they may refuse a stop or a
requested search. This includes 37% who strongly favor and 36% who
somewhat favor. A quarter of Americans oppose such a law, including
18% who somewhat oppose and 9% who strongly oppose.","This proposal enjoys strong support across partisans (Democrats
(76%), independents (74%), and Republicans (67%)) and demographic
groups. However, African Americans (63%) are somewhat less likely
than white and Hispanic Americans (74%) to support this
requirement.","About
a fifth of Americans report a police officer having used profanity
with them. An overwhelming majority (77%) of Americans say police
officers should be prohibited from using profanity or swearing at
citizens while on the job. Twenty-three percent (23%) say police
ought to be allowed to swear at citizens while on duty.","Strong majorities across demographic and political groups
similarly agree that on-duty police officers should be prohibited
from swearing at citizens. (This includes nearly equal shares of
Caucasians (77%), African Americans (82%), Hispanics (72%),
Democrats (77%), independents (77%), and Republicans (75%).)","Although Americans who score high on the Respect for Authority
Index (RAI) tend to favor giving police more latitude generally,
they are no more likely to support allowing police profanity. This
is perhaps unsurprising since those with above average respect for
authority also expect authority figures to demonstrate magnanimity
and fatherliness.87","Police may
pull over a driver of a vehicle to issue a traffic violation or
investigate a possible crime if the officer has reasonable
suspicion that a crime has or is about to occur. The officer may
search a person’s car if the officer has probable cause.88 Police may also briefly stop
pedestrians and search them for weapons given a reasonable
suspicion the person may be involved in criminal activity.","What do Americans believe should give police officers
justifiable grounds to stop and search a person? We asked
respondents about hypothetical police practices to discern their
views about the proper standard to govern police searches.","Two-thirds
(66%) of Americans favor allowing police in their area to “stop and
search a person for weapons or drugs” if that person “looks
suspicious or out of place,” including 31% who strongly favor and
35% who somewhat favor. A third say “looking suspicious or out of
place” is not sufficient reason to stop and search a person for
weapons or drugs, including 21% who somewhat oppose and 13% who
strongly oppose.","African Americans (52%) are considerably less likely than
Hispanics (76%) and Caucasians (66%) to support giving police
officers such discretion. Age also matters: Baby Boomers (82%) are
most supportive of the described practice and millennials (55%)
least.","Republicans (75%) are more likely than Democrats (60%) and
independents (64%) to allow police to use their subjective judgment
about who looks out of place when deciding whom to stop and search.
“Very liberal” respondents stand out as the only political group
with a majority (60%) opposed and 40% in favor.","Those who score high (87%) on the Respect for Authority Index
(RAI) are 44 points more likely than those who score low (43%) to
allow police to stop and search people based on looking suspicious
or out of place.89","Americans who have experienced a police search, or know someone
who has, are somewhat more skeptical of giving police this kind of
autonomy. Nevertheless, majorities with (59%) and without (70%)
this experience support such discretion.","The practice described rests, at best, on questionable
constitutional grounds. 90 It is somewhat similar to what
critics accused the New York Police Department’s Stop and Frisk
program of doing.91 Critics argued that the NYPD gave
officers too much latitude in deciding whom to stop and had
violated Americans’ Fourth Amendment protections from unreasonable
searches and seizures.92","Public support for the described practice is not unconditional.
Individuals might oppose it if they were to learn they disagreed
with police about what exactly “looks suspicious or out of place.”
Furthermore, since 63% oppose racial profiling, Americans would
oppose police discretion informed by racial bias.","Reformers might consider why many Americans support such
ostensibly unconstitutional practices. Many may personally feel
uncomfortable around individuals who appear out of place and
believe their discomfort should govern police stops. Therefore,
reformers might explain the value of Fourth Amendment protections
against unreasonable search and seizure. Among audiences who revere
the US Constitution, reformers might expound on why the founders
implemented these protections.","Americans
believe that police stops and searches of individuals usually
reveal useful information to fight crime. More than three-fourths
(77%) of Americans believe police searches reveal useful
information at least “some of the time” (54%), including 20% who
say “most of the time” and 3% who say “almost every time.” Only 23%
think police searches rarely yield evidence of criminal wrongdoing,
including 18% who say it’s “not that often,” and 5% who say “hardly
ever.”","Among
those who think searches reveal useful evidence most of the time,
88% favor police conducting searches of people who the officer
thinks looks suspicious, while 13% oppose. However among those who
think searches reveal evidence “not that often,” only 41% support
giving police more latitude and 57% are opposed.","In short, Americans appear more likely to allow officers to use
greater discretion when deciding whom to stop and search if they
believe searches reliably uncover evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
However, some research suggests police stops and searches may not
be particularly efficacious.93 These data provide some
indication that if this were generally known, the public might
oppose giving police such latitude in conducting stops and
searches.","The Supreme Court has ruled that police
officers are allowed to search cars without a warrant if they have
probable cause to believe that a person has engaged in some form of
criminal activity.94 However, officers are not permitted
to routinely search people’s cars for weapons, drugs, or contraband
“just in case.” Searching a suspected criminal’s house, in most
circumstances, requires police to first obtain a warrant.95","Would Americans tolerate police searches without probable cause
or a warrant? The answer is no: majorities think law enforcement
ought to meet a higher standard before subjecting even suspected
criminals to additional scrutiny.","Vehicle
Searches Americans acutely concerned about drug
prohibition might support police using minor traffic stops to
routinely check cars for illegal drugs and other contraband.
Although this practice is unconstitutional, some might reason: if
one isn’t breaking the law, one should have nothing to worry
about.96 Do Americans think police should use
minor traffic stops to routinely check cars for illegal
activity-just in case?","No. A solid majority of Americans-63%-say police officers should
not be allowed to routinely search cars for drugs during minor
traffic stops, unless they get a court order. A third say police

War may foster support for unconstitutional practices.","Home Searches What about searching a person’s
home? If a police officer suspects a person deals drugs, do
Americans think police ought to obtain a court order before
entering the house to search for drugs or other illegal
activity?","Yes. A strong majority 66% of Americans oppose police searching
the homes of individuals suspected of dealing drugs without first
obtaining a court order. A third say police should not have to get

fight the Drug War. Reformers may wish to keep in mind that those
committed to drug prohibition may not respond to constitutional
arguments criticizing warrantless searches.","Americans may be willing to make exceptions regarding search
warrants depending on their emotional reaction to the suspect. In a
survey conducted several days after the November 2015 Paris
attacks, 51% said police ought to obtain a court order before
searching the home of a person who might be sympathetic to

evangelicals (56%), high-school graduates (64%), and Hispanics
(63%) favor such warrantless searches. Differences in educational
attainment appear to largely underlie the ethnicity gap on this
question.","Although partisans largely agree, there are striking ideological
differences. Libertarians are most opposed (72%) to warrantless

of a person who might be sympathetic to terrorists.","By a
margin of 76% to 24%, Americans highly oppose police monitoring
phone calls of individuals suspected of criminal activity without a

monitoring of suspected criminals. However, there are some
differences. Although a majority (60%) of Hispanics oppose such a
practice, they are about 20 points less likely than blacks and

high school degrees (31%) and incomes below $30,000 (32%) are about
twice as likely as those with post-graduate degrees (15%) and
household incomes above $80,000 (12%) to support this kind of

Tolerance for Warrantless Searches","Americans generally oppose police searches of cars and houses
and monitoring phone calls without a court order. Several patterns
emerge across demographics and ideology. Majorities oppose such
unconstitutional searches, but women, evangelicals, high school
graduates, and Hispanics are relatively more supportive. Men,
non-evangelicals, college graduates, and non-Hispanics are less
supportive of warrantless searches and phone monitoring.","Perhaps surprisingly, Democrats and Republicans tend to oppose
warrantless police searches and phone monitoring by similar
margins. (They differ in support for police checking cars for drugs
during traffic stops, however.) Instead, striking differences
emerge by ideology. Libertarians and Liberals are most skeptical of
warrantless searches and surveillance, followed by Conservatives,
and then Communitarians. Libertarians and Communitarians are polar
opposites with the former roughly 20-35 points less supportive.","According
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, police make about 1.6 million
drug arrests each year.100 Some say legalizing or
decriminalizing drugs like marijuana could improve police-citizen
relations by reducing the frequency and intensity of
interactions.101 Such changes could also free up
additional resources for police to control property and violent
crime. What do Americans think?","Fifty-seven percent (57%) of Americans say they would favor
legalizing marijuana and having the government regulate it like
alcohol. Only 15% favor a similar policy for drugs like
cocaine.","Although
few Americans support across the board drug legalization, they are
open to decriminalizing drugs. A majority-54%-support
“re-categorizing drug offenses from felonies to civil offenses” and
instead treating them “like minor traffic violations rather than
crimes.”","Support for legalizing marijuana enjoys similar support across
most demographic groups. However, Americans over 65 are the only
age cohort opposed to legalization, by a margin of 36% to 64%.
Results are reversed among millennials, with 64% in favor and 36%
opposed.","Conservatives
stand out as highly opposed to marijuana legalization by a margin
of 64% to 36%. Conversely, solid majorities of Liberals (79%)
Libertarians (69%), and a slim majority of Communitarians (53%),
favor legalizing marijuana and regulating it like alcohol.102","Similarly, most groups favor re-categorizing drug offenses from
felonies to civil offenses. There are a few exceptions: a slim
majority of women (52%) oppose decriminalizing drugs, while 59% of
men favor. Similarly 55% of seniors oppose, but 56% of Americans
under 65 favor decriminalization. Conservatives strongly oppose
(64%) decriminalizing drug offenses. In contrast, Liberals (74%)
and Libertarians (67%) solidly support it, while Communitarians are
evenly divided (50%).","This report has examined public support for reforms police
departments could implement in efforts to improve relations with
their communities. However, some Americans believe that their
fellow citizens, not the police, are primarily responsible for
strained relations. They believe too few people show adequate
respect for the law and the law’s enforcers and thus citizens
should improve their behavior first. For instance, one online
commenter wrote:","“I wonder how many deaths or injuries by law enforcement
would have been prevented if the person would have shown respect to
the officer, obeyed the directions, and didn’t try to resist arrest
or flee. We need to better support our officers and not try to
defend the criminals who get by with all of the above.”",,"Two-thirds (65%) of respondents say police officers have “very
dangerous” jobs, 30% say police jobs are “somewhat dangerous” and
only 5% say their jobs are not very dangerous. 103 In
addition, most Americans (58%) believe their fellow citizens show
“too little respect” for the police these days. Only a third think
people show sufficient respect. Many Americans also don’t perceive
systemic problems in policing. Americans give high marks to local
law enforcement for enforcing the law (59%), using the appropriate
amount of force (58%), being courteous (57%), being honest (57%),
protecting people from violent crime (56%), treating all racial
groups equally (56%), responding quickly to a call for help (56%),
and caring about their community (55%). Furthermore, 54% believe
officers are generally held accountable for misconduct when it
occurs. (See Appendix B for a full breakdown.)","If people a) believe police are in a dangerous line of work, b)
believe citizens disrespect the police, and c) do not perceive
systemic problems in law enforcement-it becomes less surprising
that 61% of Americans think there is a “war on police” today.","What does the public think a “war on police” means? The term
“war” can mean “a state of open, armed, often prolonged conflict
carried on between nations, states, or parties.” Police and
citizens do have violent interactions; some have latterly become
public controversies. But “war” also means “a condition of active
antagonism or contention.”104 There is reason to
believe that most Americans think the “war on police” is largely
the latter given that those who argue of its existence say it’s a
rhetorical war. For instance, Heather MacDonald argues in her
recent book The War on Cops that the war is due
to”virulent anti-cop rhetoric” [emphasis added]. 105 Furthermore police fatalities are
lower today than in the past. 106","Although people across racial and partisan groups believe the
police have dangerous jobs, they disagree about whether police are
disrespected or are under attack.","White Americans are 20-30 points more likely than African
Americans to say people aren’t showing enough respect for police
(64% vs. 34%) and to believe there is a war on police (64% vs.
46%). Hispanics fall in between with a plurality (45%) who say
police don’t get adequate respect and a slim majority (52%) who
believe there is a war on police. In contrast, majorities of
African Americans say there is no war on police (54%) and that
officers receive adequate respect (54%).","Partisanship also matters. Republicans are about 30-40 points
more likely than Democrats to believe that police aren’t receiving
adequate deference (77% vs. 45%) and to believe the police are
under attack (82% vs. 40%). Independents lean with Republicans,
with 56% who believe people don’t show enough respect for officers
and 56% who believe there is a war on police.",,,"Again, race
matters more than partisanship. White Republicans are the most
likely group to believe the police aren’t receiving enough respect;
they are nearly 30 points more likely than white Democrats to feel
this way (81% vs. 51%). However, black Republicans are no more
likely than black Democrats to agree (35% vs. 39%).107 Older Americans are also more
concerned for police than younger Americans. Seniors (78%) are 33
points more likely than millennials (45%) to think the police
aren’t getting the respect they deserve. Seniors are also 21 points
more likely than millennials to believe that a war is being waged
on cops (76% vs. 55%).","Unsurprisingly, the Respect for Authority Index (RAI) is highly
correlated with concern about people respecting police.108 Three-fourths (76%) of those who
have a high respect for authority believe the police aren’t getting
the respect they deserve, compared to only 35% of those who have a
low RAI score.","Our look at public opinion and the perceived “war on police”
offers lessons to criminal justice reformers. Many people have had
good experiences with the police and don’t perceive systemic
problems in policing. Such people might assume that citizens
instigate conflict with the police. Some people greatly trust
authority figures like the police whom they see as the ultimate
linchpin of societal order. People with such experience and views
of authority may see intensifying criticism of the police and
impassioned calls for reform (“active antagonism and contention”)
as an attack on police legitimacy, and thereby, law and order.","As they seek to persuade their fellow citizens, reformers should
consider the implications of this analysis. Has their audience
generally had positive or negative interactions with the police? Do
they have a propensity to trust authority figures? If so, reformers
should present evidence that speaks directly to these experiences
and assumptions. Reformers might indicate their shared commitment
to helping police to promote law and order. They can then explain
how their reforms will accomplish these goals and improve police
safety and police-community relations.","Black, white, and Hispanic Americans see the police differently.
They differ about police efficacy, impartiality, honesty, empathy,
tactics, and accountability. Their views may vary in part because
Hispanic, black, and white Americans report considerably different
personal and vicarious experiences with police officers. For
instance, some groups are more likely to report verbal or physical
abuse from officers. Taken together, these disparate perceptions
and reported experiences form a deep divide in favorability toward
law enforcement.","However, many overlook agreement among these groups. Americans
across race and ethnicity agree on what policing should be and on
which reforms should be adopted.","Blacks, whites, and Hispanics all agree on the top priorities
for law enforcement, maintaining current levels of policing
presence in their communities, and the danger inherent in police
work. Majorities of Hispanic, white, and black Americans also
support a variety of police reforms: more training, body cameras,
warnings to citizens about stops and searches, and independent
investigations of alleged police misconduct. Similarly, majorities
oppose a variety of possible police practices: racial profiling,
routine use of military weapons and armored vehicles, pretextual
vehicle stops to search for drugs without a warrant, seizing
personal and private property before a person is convicted of a
crime (civil asset forfeiture), and officers swearing at citizens.
Majorities also support decriminalizing drug offenses from felony
to civil charges, a change that might improve interactions between
police and citizens.","Americans may consider police reforms without perceiving all
possible problems and systemic biases in policing. Reformers need
not insist that others agree with, and adopt their perceptions of
policing today. Instead, by acknowledging concerns and emphasizing
shared beliefs about what policing ought to be, reformers can forge
a consensus to improve policies on behalf of officers, citizens,
and the larger community.",,Notes:,Notes:,"1 In

Despite falling crime rates nationally, some surveys show Americans
continue to believe crime is getting worse each year. For instance,
Gallup found about two-thirds of Americans say there is more crime
in the United States today that there was a year ago, and that this
share has increased over time. Even at a local level, about half of
Americans say there is “more crime” in their area than there was a
year ago. However, although Americans may say crime is higher, this
report shows they are less concerned about being a crime victim
than in the past, which reflects the fact that crime rates are
decreasing. See Justin McCarthy, “Most Americans Still See Crime Up

police contact may itself mediate other attitudes and perceptions.

The legal rationale is that the property itself may be involved in
a crime, and thus must be seized. However in practice, since
property can be seized without charging a person with a crime or

Arthur Garrison points out that “furtive movements” and presence in
a high crime area were the two most commonly given reasons in
police reports for pedestrian stops between 2004-2009. Furthermore,
78% of all stops between 2004-2009 were initiated by a police
officer, not the result of a service call. Since the reasons for
these stops were fairly broad, critics argued police had too much
latitude in deciding whom to stop and search and this gave way to
racial profiling. Arthur H. Garrison, “NYPD Stop and Frisk,

"DALLAS (CN) – A fired white police officer told a Dallas County jury Thursday he had no choice but to fire on a car to protect his fellow officer, killing unarmed black 15-year-old Jordan Edwards.","Roy Oliver, 38, of Combine, was dressed in a gray suit and green-striped tie as he testified in his murder trial that he had “no information” on who a purported shooter was when he arrived at the scene of reported gunfire in April 2017, and he focused on the Chevrolet Impala that Edwards and several others were in because it was a threat to another officer when he arrived.","“As I came to level ground, the vehicle came to a stop for a slight moment, then accelerated forward,” Oliver said as he showed jurors with his hands the proximity of the car towards his partner. “As it was gaining ground towards him, I had to make a decision. This car is about to hit my partner, there are threats inside the car. When lethal force headed towards us, I had no other option but to use lethal force.”","Oliver fired five shots from his rifle, one of which struck Edwards, of Mesquite, in the head. Within days, Oliver was fired from the Balch Spring Police Department and sued in federal court by Edwards’ father.","Edwards, his brother, a stepbrother and two friends were leaving a party when it was announced police were on their way to shut it down and they had nothing to do with the gunshots that were heard, the lawsuit states.","Edwards’ father paints Oliver as a hothead, citing complaints made by Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson’s office that he would allegedly become aggressive and use vulgar language while testifying as a witness in previous cases.","Oliver showed no signs of aggressiveness during his testimony Thursday, speaking steadily and methodically as he responded to questions from defense attorney Jim Lane.",He testified that he is “heartbroken” by Edwards’ death but that he believes he responded appropriately to the perceived threat.,"“My heart sank,” he said when discovering Edwards was dead. “It was hard to breathe.”",Oliver also testified about his past service in the U.S. Army and a past deployment to Iraq. He became emotional when he talked about enduring mortar fire and the death of friends during a suicide bombing.,"On cross-examination, prosecutors displayed large photographs of Edwards’ blood-soaked body to the jurors. Assistant District Attorney Mike Snipes asked Oliver why he did not fire warning shots or shoot the tires out. Oliver responded that such action is not allowed and “not safe”",“Were you trying to seriously injure or kill the driver of the car?” Snipes asked. “There’s no other reason to fire four or five shots into the car.”,"“I was trying to stop the threat inside the vehicle, correct,” Oliver responded. “I was not aware it was four or five shots.”","Testimony ended on Friday, with the defense resting and prosecutors calling Monique Arredondo as a rebuttal witness. She testified that Oliver was “angry” and “raging” after she rear-ended his personal truck two weeks before Edwards’ death and failed to identify himself as a cop.","“As soon as we impacted, I see a man get out of his truck quickly, approach our vehicle and point his gun at my sister,” she told jurors.",Her testimony came after defense attorneys failed to persuade state District Judge Brandon Birmingham to bar her and her sister as witnesses. The judge reasoned the testimony was allowed since Oliver testified about the accident during direct examination by his attorneys.,Closing arguments will begin on Monday.,"Edwards’ death resulted in an the announcement of an investigation by the Department of Justice in May 2017, as the country continues to grapple with the issue of excessive force being used by police on young black males.","Balch Springs, population 24,000, is a suburb to the southeast of Dallas."
"The county sheriff in charge of investigating the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, pleaded with lawmakers on Thursday to give police and doctors more power to involuntarily hospitalize people for psychiatric evaluation over violent and threatening social media posts.","The sheriff, Scott Israel, of Broward County, described the accused shooter's social media posts as ""very disturbing"" at a news conference and asked state and federal legislators to expand the state's Baker Act, which says a person can be detained against their will for up to 72 hours under certain circumstances.","The accused, Nikolas Cruz, 19, has confessed to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday, authorities said. He has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.","Israel said the Baker Act allows law enforcement or medical professionals to confine a person involuntarily, ""but you have to have a reason, you have to be able to articulate that they're a threat to themselves or a threat to someone else.""","Israel pleaded with lawmakers in Tallahassee, the state capital, and Washington to give police the power to detain people ""if they see something on social media, if they see graphic pictures of rifles and blood and gore and guns and bombs, if they see something, horrific language, if they see a person talking about ‘I want to grow up to be a serial killer.'""","""People are going to be rightfully so concerned about their rights, as am I, but what about the rights of these students?"" the sheriff said. “What about the rights of young kids who go to schools with book bags and pencils? Don't they have the right to be protected by the United States government to the best of our ability?""",Attorney General Jeff Sessions echoed the need for allowing law enforcement to intervene in certain circumstances in an interview with right-wing site Breitbart News.,Related: FBI was alerted about school shooting threat on YouTube,"""All of law enforcement is deeply concerned about this trend of violence in schools and other, similar places,"" he said.","""I was with the Major County Sheriffs' Association this morning, and they all said, and believe, that there are signals and signs before these shootings that, if recognized, could lead to intervention, and could stop these events from occurring,"" Sessions said.","Annette Christy, director of the Baker Act Reporting Center, which collects and analyses data on involuntary hospitalizations in the state, said there usually has to be ""evidence of harm, self-harm or harm to others, or self-neglect and evidence of mental illness.""","Christy, an associate professor at the University of South Florida, said, however, that people with mental illness have a right to live their lives and that’s why the “harm criteria are important.”","""When it crosses a line — when somebody is a harm to themselves so others — their civil liberties can be taken away to protect themselves and protect people in the public,"" she said.","A 2017 report on the Baker Act by the center found that there were 194,354 involuntary examinations in fiscal year 2015-16, a 3.4 percent increase from the prior fiscal years and a 33.8 percent increase from fiscal year 2010-11. About half of the involuntary exams were initiated by law enforcement, according to the report.","Christy said that there was currently no language in the law regarding disturbing social media posts or images and that specific situations that can lead to a Baker Act exam ""out in the real world can vary quite a bit.""","She added that while she understood the point of Israel's request, ""that’s widening the net way wide.""","""We need to develop prevention and alternatives for law enforcement so they don’t have to bring youths in,"" she said. ""I really get it, but we need to think of these other possibilities, because the goal is you don’t want to end up that things get so bad that he has to have a Baker Act exam.""","She also noted that ""Florida is a very poorly funded state in terms of mental health.""",Israel in an appearance on MSNBC Thursday night said he was not calling for law enforcement to become involved just because someone posts a photo of a weapon.,"""I'm talking about being around bombs, possibly talking about ‘I want to be a serial killer,’ talking about taking people’s lives,” Israel said. ""Just taking a picture with a gun or a knife or a weapon — that in and of itself is clearly not even remotely something that we’re concerned about.""","He said that ""we need to do things differently"" and empower police to help get people who need mental health treatment help.","""I feel strongly about that. And everybody has their opinion, but I have mine, and I don't know how many people with their opinions went into a school yesterday and saw 17 dead people,"" Israel said.","Cruz was expelled from the school where the shooting took place, and one former classmate said he sometimes posted pictures of ""dead lizards and stuff that he shot"" on his Instagram feed.","Additionally, a YouTube user who used the same name as Cruz was investigated by the FBI for a comment boasting about plans to shoot up a school last September, the agency said.

The entire United States of America has become a Constitution-free zone.","According to journalist Todd Miller, the “once thin borderline of the American past” is “an ever-thickening band, now extending 100 miles inland around the United States—along the 2,000-mile southern border, the 4,000-mile northern border and both coasts... This ‘border’ region now covers places where two-thirds of the US population (197.4 million people) live… The ‘border’ has by now devoured the full states of Maine and Florida and much of Michigan.”",The U.S. government has also declared that ever-expanding border region a Constitution-free zone.,"Second, this de facto standing army that has been imposed on the American people is in clear violation of the spirit—if not the letter of the law—of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the government’s ability to use the U.S. military as a police force.","America’s police forces—which look like, dress like, and act like the military—have undeniably become a “standing” or permanent army, one composed of full-time professional soldiers who do not disband, which is exactly what the Founders feared.","Third, there’s the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security made up of more than 60,000 Customs and Border Protection employees, and supplemented by the National Guard and the U.S. military.","A national police force imbued with all the brutality, ineptitude and corruption such a role implies, the DHS—aptly described as a “wasteful, growing, fear-mongering beast”—has been ruthlessly efficient when it comes to establishing what the Founders feared most: a standing army on American soil.","Finally, there’s this whole question of martial law.","Technically, a good case can be made that the Constitution-free border regions within the United States are already under martial law carried out by a standing army comprised of militarized police and the U.S. military.","Then again, for all intents and perhaps, the American police state is already governed by martial law, is it not? Battlefield tactics. Militarized police. Riot and camouflage gear. Armored vehicles. Mass arrests. Pepper spray. Tear gas. Batons. Strip searches. Drones. Less-than-lethal weapons unleashed with deadly force. Rubber bullets. Water cannons. Concussion grenades. Intimidation tactics. Brute force. Laws conveniently discarded when it suits the government’s purpose.","This is what martial law looks like, when a government disregards constitutional freedoms and imposes its will through military force, only this is martial law without any government body having to declare it. This is martial law packaged as law and order and sold to the public as necessary for keeping the peace.","It doesn’t matter whether the so-called threats to national security posed by terrorists, extremists or immigrant armies ever became a reality. Once the government acquires—and uses—additional powers, it does not voluntarily relinquish them.",The damage has been done.,Face it: we are sliding fast down a slippery slope to a Constitution-free America.,"We’ve been heading in this direction for some time now, but this downward trajectory has picked up speed since Donald Trump became president.",All of the government’s ongoing assaults on the constitutional framework of the nation have been sold to the public as necessary for national security.,"Remember when George W. Bush claimed the country was being invaded by terrorists post-9/11 and insisted the only way to keep America safe was to give the government and its gun-toting agents greater powers to spy, search, detain and arrest?","The terrorist invasion never really happened, but the government kept its newly acquired police powers made possible by the USA Patriot Act.","Remember when Barack Obama claimed the country was being invaded by domestic terrorists and insisted the only way to keep America safe was to give the military the power to strip Americans of their constitutional rights, label them extremists, and detain them indefinitely without trial?","The invasion never really happened, but the government kept its newly acquired detention powers made possible by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).",Now you have Donald Trump claiming the country is being invaded by immigrants and insisting that the only way to keep America safe is to empower the military to “assist” with border control.,"Mind you, Trump is not the first president to deploy military forces to the border.","Nevertheless, you can rest assured that this latest call for boots on the ground (whether those boots belong to the National Guard or the armed forces is mere semantics) to police the American border is yet another Trojan Horse that will inflict all manner of nasty police state surprises on an unsuspecting populace.","As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the menace of a national police force—a.k.a. a standing army—vested with the power to completely disregard the Constitution, cannot be overstated, nor can its danger be ignored.",Tips: tips@zerohedge.com,General: info@zerohedge.com,Legal: legal@zerohedge.com,Advertising: ads@zerohedge.com,Abuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com,Advertise With Us,"Make sure to read our ""How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters]"" Guide","It would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer, our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure.

Icicles in many shapes and forms develop on the ever changing shoreline of Lake Superior.,Photo: Brian Mark Peterson / Star Tribune,BUY,SHARE,ABOUT,Authorities partly closed a downtown Minneapolis freeway briefly Tuesday morning as they made a “high-risk” traffic stop to detain a motorist who allegedly brandished a gun at another driver.,"Turns out the driver was an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a State Patrol report said.","The incident began about 6:40 a.m. on eastbound I-694 in Brooklyn Park, when a motorist called police to report that another driver was displaying a gun.",Police caught up to the driver on I-94 at Olson Highway and blocked two southbound lanes long enough that traffic backed up to W. Broadway. The State Patrol took the man into custody but released him after officers learned he was an ATF agent who was carrying proper credentials.,"“It’s under investigation,” said Lt. Eric Roeske of the Minnesota State Patrol. “We’re trying to determine the facts of what occurred.”","The agent’s name was not released per Minnesota Statute 13.82, which allows the identity of an undercover law enforcement officer to be kept private.",An ATF spokesman said Tuesday afternoon that the incident was under review.,TIM HARLOW and JOY POWELL,© 2018 StarTribune.

Menu,"Credit freezes are the best way to prevent new account fraud, where criminals open bogus accounts in your name. But one credit bureau’s site made it distressingly easy to circumvent the security that’s supposed to keep your credit reports safe.",Experian’s site exposed the personal identification numbers — the PINs needed to thaw credit freezes — after users answered their security questions with a blanket answer: None of the above.,"More than a year ago, security expert Brian Krebs reported a similar flaw. At that point, people had to correctly answer the four “knowledge-based authentication” questions used to identify them. The problem with this method, according to Krebs, is that the personal information needed to successfully guess the answers is readily available online through commercial as well as criminal sites.",But for several hours Thursday — and for who knows how long before that — you didn’t even have to guess.,"A reader alerted us to this issue, and several of us who had

The form required an email address, which didn’t necessarily have to be the one associated with the person’s Experian account. Answering “none of the above” to the security questions — even if some of the proffered answers were correct — gave access to that person’s PIN.","With the PIN, anyone can thaw that person’s credit freeze and apply for credit in their name.","Consumer advocate Mike Litt was also able to retrieve his PIN using the flaw. “There is absolutely no excuse for this,” says Litt, campaign director for U.S. PIRG, a public interest advocacy organization. “How do you just leave the keys to the door on top of the welcome mat?”","An Experian spokesman issued a statement Thursday afternoon that said, “While we are confident that our authentication is secure and no credit files are at risk, we have taken additional steps to make the process more secure. We continue to regularly monitor our systems, taking immediate action when warranted to strengthen data security.”","By late Thursday, many of us started getting the error messages that our responses should have generated in the first place. We were directed to mail Experian our identifying information, such as copies of our driver’s license, utility bills and Social Security card.","The U.S. mail, in case this needs to be said, is not a safe way to transmit such information. But since these details are likely in criminal hands already, we’ll leave that for now.","This is yet another reminder that we need to keep monitoring our credit reports and scores for fraudulent accounts, even if we have credit freezes in place — as we still should.","What’s really distressing is that security freezes are supposed to be one of the few effective bulwarks people can put up against fraud. That’s why security experts have recommended them for years, and why Congress finally made freezes and thaws free starting Sept. 21.","The ease with which this essential protection could be thwarted tells us that the

"Jackie Wilson and his brother, Andrew Wilson, were found guilty of killing Chicago police Officers Richard J. O'Brien and William Fahey in 1982. Though Wilson contends that police abused him during interrogation, his bid for a new trial is based in part on evidence that Burge or his subordinates tortured other men, including his co-defendant and brother Andrew, who was found by doctors after his interrogation to have numerous injuries.","Jackie Wilson, one of two brothers convicted in one of Chicago’s most infamous cop killings, walked out of Cook County Jail on Friday, a free man for the first time in more than 36 years.","The sudden freedom for Wilson, 57, came after Cook County Circuit Judge William Hooks ordered his release a few hours earlier. The judge had tossed out his murder conviction last week after finding that notorious ex-Chicago police Cmdr. Jon Burge and detectives under his command had physically coerced his confession.","Saying nearly four decades in prison had aged Wilson “far beyond his chronological age,” Hooks held Friday that he did not pose a danger to the community or a risk to flee — factors in whether he could be released.","The judge also said special prosecutors “utterly failed” in their arguments to keep Wilson in jail, adding that they appeared to want him to view the case “through the lens of a court sitting in 1982 or 1988 without considering the revelations that have come to light over the last three decades.”","Scores of African-American men have accused Burge, who is white, and his colleagues of torturing or abusing them during the 1970s and 1980s at a South Side police station. The scandal has stained the city’s reputation and cost taxpayers at least $115 million so far in lawsuit settlements, judgments and other compensation to victims.",Relatives of slain Officers Richard O’Brien and William Fahey left the Leighton Criminal Court Building without comment after Hooks’ ruling. Special prosecutor Michael O’Rourke said they were understandably upset by the decision.,"Kevin Graham, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, who attended the hearing, called Hooks’ ruling “disgraceful.”","“I’m very disappointed that a man that is responsible, who was at the scene, that has admitted to being there when two honored police officers of the Chicago Police Department were murdered, gunned down, and he walks out,” Graham said.","As reporters and cameramen crowded around him during his exit from the jail, Wilson said he was “happy to be a member of society again.”","“Being a victim of one of a number of Jon Burge’s brutalities … ” he said as his voice trailed off and he sighed heavily. “Oh Lord, it’s just, it’s been a rocky ride.”","As Wilson walked toward a waiting car, a nearby woman cried out, “Thank God you’re free.” Wilson stepped toward her, grasped her hand and kissed it before departing.","The woman, Ilicea Barnes, 51, said she just happened to be nearby and was moved when she heard an inmate would be walking free after being locked up so long.","“Just imagine all he has missed and lost,” she told reporters.","Wilson’s attorneys said they have arranged for a social worker and a psychologist to help ease his transition from prison. Citing fears for his safety, they declined to say where he planned to live.","G. Flint Taylor, a Wilson lawyer who has represented numerous alleged victims of Burge over the years, called on the special prosecutors to drop the murder charges, saying they had no viable case now that the confession had been thrown out","“Any self-respecting prosecutor would dismiss this case,” Taylor told reporters.","But O’Rourke, who leads the special prosecution team, vowed to vigorously pursue the prosecution as he maintained there was ample evidence besides the tainted confession to prove Wilson’s guilt.","“Jon Burge has no effect on the evidence to prove the actual criminal conduct, which is separate and apart from anything Burge-related,” he said. “We have witnesses and we have testimony that’s completely non-Burge-related that will set out this case and set it out in convincing fashion.”",The ruling to free Wilson comes as special prosecutors filed paperwork earlier this week indicating they will ask an appeals court to reverse Hooks’ decision to throw out the conviction and order a retrial.,"Neither side in this decades-old court battle disputes that Wilson’s now-dead brother, Andrew, fatally shot the two officers during a traffic stop or that Jackie Wilson was present. What will be at issue in a retrial is whether Jackie Wilson played an active role in the killing.","His lawyers assert that at least one witness says Wilson appeared to be in a “state of shock” during the shooting. But prosecutors contend that Wilson was hardly an innocent figure, arguing that both brothers were on the way to try to break out another accused cop killer from custody when they were pulled over by O’Brien and Fahey.","Wilson’s first conviction was tossed out after an appeals court ruled that he should not have been tried simultaneously with his brother. At a retrial in 1989, a jury acquitted him of Fahey’s murder but convicted him of O’Brien’s. He was sentenced to life in prison.","At a hearing Thursday, the team of special prosecutors laid out their case for keeping Wilson in custody pending a third trial. Prosecutors summarized the expected testimony of several witnesses, including eyewitnesses who implicated Wilson as well as correctional officers who allegedly heard him take credit for the slayings while in custody.","But on questioning by the judge, prosecutors acknowledged they didn’t know whether any of the witnesses were still alive to testify.","That left Hooks, who has sparred in court with the special prosecutors for months, incredulous.","“You can’t tell me what witnesses will be able to come into the courtroom, raise their right hand and testify?” the judge asked.","In response, Wilson’s attorneys revealed that one of those witnesses has recanted in the past month, claiming he was threatened decades ago into making false statements from the witness stand.","Prosecutors cast doubt on the reliability of the witness’s affidavit, expressing skepticism because it took him so long to come forward.","But Hooks, raising his voice, was insistent that he could not consider the credibility of decades-old testimony outside the context of what has been revealed about Burge in the years since.",Disciplinary authorities fired Burge in 1993 after determining he had tortured Andrew Wilson.,"Burge was convicted in federal court of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2010 after jurors found he lied when he denied witnessing torture or abusing suspects in connection with a lawsuit. While he was not charged with torture, prosecutors had to prove allegations of abuse to support the other counts. Burge spent 4½ years in prison and on home confinement.",The Burge scandal has long fueled resentment among African-Americans who have accused the Police Department of widespread abuse and racism.,Those feelings were exacerbated in late 2015 after the court-ordered release of a video showing white Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black teen Laquan McDonald 16 times as he walked away from police with a knife in his hand. The furor over the shooting sparked a political crisis for Mayor Rahm Emanuel and led to a push for reform of the Police Department after a scathing report by the U.S. Department of Justice found that officers were poorly trained and quick to use excessive and even deadly force without facing consequences.,mcrepeau@chicagotribune.com,Twitter @crepeau,MORE COVERAGE,"Citing torture claims, judge overturns conviction in slayings of 2 Chicago cops nearly 40 years ago »",Judge tells prosecutor to 'toughen up' during hearing in Jackie Wilson case after new trial ordered »
There's nothing magnificent about these seven.,"A crew of unscrupulous cops was thrown behind bars Wednesday for protecting a prostitution and gambling ring — where the officers, in some cases, received sex and massages for their invaluable assistance, authorities said.","Three sergeants, two detectives and two police officers were arrested and stripped of their guns and shields after they were taken in for questioning by the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau.","Two other detectives were not criminally charged, but were placed on modified duty and forced to turn in their weapons and badges. They are expected to face departmental charges.",More than a dozen other cops are being investigated and could face internal charges later.,Sources said a large chunk of the investigation centered around the Brooklyn South Narcotics Squad.,"Internal Affairs swarmed the Squad's offices Wednesday and immediately put the entire building on lockdown as they collected evidence, a source with knowledge of the case said. Everyone inside had to surrender any of their cellphones and electronic devices.","""They came in like a SWAT team,"" the source said.",Investigators were later seen carrying out lockers belonging to the implicated police officers.,The cops would allegedly tip off the head honchos of the gambling and prostitution ring — which operated in Brooklyn and Queens — about upcoming raids and search warrants.,"On some occasions, prostitutes were ordered to massage and have sex with the cops for their help, sources with knowledge of the case said.","Those arrested include Sgt. Carlos Cruz of the 69th Precinct in Brooklyn; Sgt. Louis Failla, a member of the Queens South Evidence Control Team; Sgt. Cliff Nieves, who is assigned to a Transit Bureau investigation unit; Police Officer Steven Nieves of the 84th Precinct in Brooklyn Heights; Police Officer Giancarlo Raspanti of the 109th Precinct in Flushing, Queens; Detective Giovanny Rojas-Acosta of the NYPD's Criminal Investigations Division, and Detective Rene Samaniego of the Brooklyn South Vice Squad.","Cruz, Rojas-Acosta and Samaniego are charged with enterprise corruption. Cliff Nieves and Steven Nieves are charged with promoting prostitution, while Failla and Raspanti face official misconduct charges. All seven have been suspended for 30 days without pay.","""The overwhelming number of police officers are honest and dedicated to making New York City a safe place to live,"" Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said. ""Neither my office nor Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill will tolerate that tiny percentage of officers who besmirch the reputation of the thousands upon thousands of their noble colleagues.""","The two detectives put on modified assignment are Manuel Rodriguez of the 72nd Precinct and Rafael Vega, cops said.","Failla, Raspanti and Vega all have more than 20 years with the department. Officer Nieves has the least amount of time with the NYPD — about 7 years, according to officials.","The officers may have been introduced to the ring by a retired NYPD detective who is heavily involved in the criminal organization, sources said.","A high-ranking NYPD source said the IAB investigation took three years to complete and involved ""hundreds of hours of surveillance and multiple (wiretaps).""","The officers allegedly provided a shady safety net for prostitution and gambling rings, which sources described as not being ""high end.""","As part of the protection, the officers allegedly tipped off the honchos about investigations into their illegal business.","""This was an investigation that was initiated by a member of the service, followed through by Internal Affairs and it came to this conclusion,"" a source explained. ""We're cleaning our own house. This was literally a member of the department calling IAB and saying he didn't like what was going on here.""",The seven officers are expected to be arraigned in Queens criminal court Thursday.,"An estimated 40 others involved in the prostitution and gambling ring are also expected to be charged, officials said.","""Today, those who swore an oath and then betrayed it have felt the consequences of that infidelity,"" Police Commissioner James O'Neill said. ""The people of this Department are rightly held to the highest standard, and should they fail to meet it, the penalty will be swift and severe. (The Internal Affairs Bureau) initiated this probe and in doing so, has sent a clear message: there is no place in the NYPD for criminal or unethical behavior."""

The Rangers weren't called initially - and when they were called, they didn't want the case for that same reason.","Officer involved shooting investigations in Texas are NOT all automatically handed over to the Texas Rangers.

FACT.",pic.twitter.com/nI6EKCUeRE,He also had a bright red door mat!  No way she mistakenly thought that was her apartment.,"That was the first clue for her, she know she didn't have a red door mat.  I hope someone took a picture of the area around her front door before, they try to put one a similar red door mat down. Trust none of them.",His next doo neighbor took a picture,"More than a picture, after the shots were fired, she went to her door' peephole. You can find her video, and account of what she heard here:https://heavy.com/news/2018/09/amber-guyger/ …","In this account, why would she need to go to the door of her apartment to provide the address to dispatch if she really thought she was in her apartment",She said she realized it was he wrong apt. after she shot and turned on a light. The whole thing is fishy. The guys apt had a red mat at the door. I’ve lived in high rises and gone to the wrong floor and therefore the wrong door but this whole story is fishy.,Odds are they’re going to try and put more blame on the key lock for “slightly allowing her access and opening”,"They’re trying to give her probable cause...the door was a jar...her story has never made sense. I’m angry that the police didn’t take her into custody. Did the police take her phone, search her apartment, take her electronics, impound her car as evidence, take her clothes?",Does the door lock automatically? Do residents have the option of having the door closed. but unlocked? #BothamShemJean #BlueLivesMurder #AmberGuyger,it closes on its own some one from the complex did a video of how the door works it cant be ajar if u open it,My question is: Does the door AUTOMATICALLY lock on it's own?,I REALLY am trying to find out the answer to this question.,yes it does like a hotel room. n u can double lock it from the inside,"Thanks, I was thinking that, it must operate like a hotel room door.","The minute I saw the door I knew that was the case, I stayed in a lot of hotels with doors like that, they always lock automatically and they slam shut. Not to mention the fact that she would have known she was at the wrong apartment, he had a bright red welcome mat.","

    ",DALLAS — A white former Texas police officer has been found guilty of murder on Tuesday for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager as he left a house party in a car full of teenagers.,Roy Oliver was fired from the Balch Springs Police Department days after the April 2017 shooting. Oliver killed 15-year-old Jordan Edwards after the then-officer fired into a moving car carrying five black teenagers leaving a local house party. Edwards was in the front passenger seat.,"Oliver was found not guilty of lesser charges manslaughter and aggravated assault, CBS DFW reports.",Oliver testified during the Dallas County trial that he opened fire after seeing the car move toward his partner. He says he thought his partner was in danger. But his partner told jurors he didn't fear for his life and never felt the need to fire his weapon. ,"The shooting launched the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs into a national conversation on issues of law enforcement and race. Experts said ahead of the trial that securing convictions against an officer was challenging, in part because criminal culpability in on-duty shootings is subjective and jurors are more inclined to believe police testimony. ","In closing arguments, defense attorneys told the jury they needed to evaluate the circumstances from Oliver's viewpoint and from what the former officer knew at the time. But prosecutors described Oliver as out of control and looking for a reason to kill. They argued that his firing into the car wasn't reasonable. ","The shooting came after Oliver and his partner, Tyler Gross, had broken up a large house party following a report of underage drinking. Both officers were inside the residence when they heard gunfire outside and responded. Authorities later determined the shots were fired near a nursing home in the area. ","Oliver retrieved his rifle and went toward Gross, who was ordering the car carrying Edwards to stop. Oliver testified that he saw the car back up and stop for a second before moving forward and going toward Gross. ","Testifying in his own defense, Oliver told the jury the car was about to hit his partner. Oliver said he felt he had no other option but to fire. ","Gross, however, testified that he did not fear for his life and never felt the need to fire his weapon. He also said he didn't feel like the vehicle was trying to hit him. ",Prosecutors said Oliver fired after the vehicle passed Gross. Investigators also said no guns were found in the teens' vehicle.,"

Supported by,By Mitch Smith,"CHICAGO — Almost four years ago, a white Chicago police officer fatally shot a black teenager named Laquan McDonald on a busy roadway. His death roiled this city, leading to upheaval in the police department, demonstrators in the streets and murder charges against the officer, Jason Van Dyke.","After about three weeks of testimony in Officer Van Dyke’s long-awaited trial, jurors are deliberating a verdict and Chicagoans are waiting and watching closely. Here are some of the reasons this case is so significant:","Officer Van Dyke kept shooting even after Laquan, who was 17, twisted and collapsed onto the street. The sheer quantity of bullets incensed many Chicago residents who thought that one shot was too many, and that 16 seemed incomprehensible. A police dashboard-camera video made that number visceral, as shot after shot struck Laquan’s crumpled body.","The shooting began after Laquan was reported breaking into vehicles in a trucking yard on Oct. 20, 2014. When officers arrived, Laquan, who was holding a 3-inch folding knife, walked away. As a growing number of officers began following him, he was said at one point to have “popped” the tires of a police cruiser, apparently with his knife. The officers followed from a distance for several blocks and radioed for the help of a colleague with a Taser.",Then Officer Van Dyke arrived. He jumped out of his police cruiser with his gun drawn and started shooting within seconds as Laquan moved slightly away from him. The officer said later that he feared for his safety and that of other officers.,"The video showed clouds of debris for about 15 seconds as bullets struck the teenager’s writhing body. Audio on the camera malfunctioned, and no voices or gunshots could be heard. Of at least seven other officers on the scene, none fired their guns.","The public didn’t get to see the video until November 2015, and it only came out then after a judge ordered the city of Chicago to release it. Before that, city officials had turned down requests for the images and lawyers for the city had waged a fight when they were sued for access under public record laws.","Critics of Mayor Rahm Emanuel found the timing suspicious, and suggested that the city had a specific reason for keeping the video under wraps: Mr. Emanuel was running for re-election in early 2015, and facing a competitive political climate that forced him into a runoff that April. Mr. Emanuel has denied those accusations, and city officials said the video was withheld because of the criminal investigation of Officer Van Dyke.","[Read more about the case, and how it has affected Chicago, here.]","For weeks after the footage was released, protesters marched through downtown chanting “16 shots and a cover-up” and demanding that Mr. Emanuel resign.","Laquan was killed about two months after the police shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., touched off tense protests and started a national conversation about police tactics. Laquan’s death, by contrast, drew little immediate notice and only cursory local news coverage.","That changed more than a year after Laquan’s death, when the judge ordered that the video be made public. Hours before its release, prosecutors charged Officer Van Dyke with murder.","In a city where police officers have been involved in dozens of controversial shootings without facing charges, the case against Officer Van Dyke has taken on added significance. Relations between the police and residents, especially black residents, have long been troubled, and some people see the trial as a rare test of whether an officer can ever be held accountable for taking a life.","Around the country, even when officers are charged, cases often end without convictions. Recent trials in Milwaukee, St. Paul, Cincinnati and St. Louis resulted in acquittals or mistrials. A Chicago officer was last convicted of murder for an on-duty shooting in 1970, according to The Chicago Tribune.","At trial, officers frequently say that they feared for their life or someone else’s when they fired their weapon, and Officer Van Dyke has indicated that he’ll put forward a similar defense.","Police officers have wide latitude to use deadly force, and the Supreme Court has allowed them do so when they have a reasonable fear of death or serious injury to themselves or another person.","“It’s hard to overcome an officer’s subjective belief that he needed to use deadly force,” said Jeffrey Urdangen, a longtime Illinois defense lawyer and the director of the Center for Criminal Defense at Northwestern University’s law school.","Still, some officers are convicted of murder, including  last month in Texas, and the video of Laquan’s death could give prosecutors an advantage. Officer Van Dyke’s lawyers would have to convince jurors that Laquan was the aggressor that night.","“That’s a tall order for the defense, in my view,” Mr. Urdangen said.","Race is central to this case. During jury selection last week, each side accused the other of excluding people based solely on skin color. Prosecutors said defense lawyers unfairly removed black people from the jury pool; Officer Van Dyke’s lawyers said the prosecution wrongly excluded white men.","In the end, of 12 Chicago-area residents chosen for the jury, six appeared to be white, three Hispanic, one black and one Asian. The twelfth juror appeared to be white or Hispanic. (Almost one-quarter of people in Cook County, which includes Chicago, are black, and about 40 percent are white.)","It had been unclear until Friday whether a jury would even hear the case. Officer Van Dyke’s defense lawyers tried and repeatedly failed to get the trial moved out of Cook County, where police-community relations are strained, to a suburban or downstate county with a higher proportion of white people and more reverence for law enforcement.","“There’s people out there, especially in Chicago,” said Alan Tuerkheimer, a jury consultant, “who think there’s this code of silence, that police officers look out for each other, that they use excessive force.”","Police officers charged with crimes often prefer that judges — not juries — hear their cases, but Officer Van Dyke’s lawyers ultimately chose to have a jury. They had the option of putting the case before a judge, but that decision would have put the verdict in the hands of Judge Vincent Gaughan. He is viewed as a mercurial jurist, having briefly jailed Officer Van Dyke earlier this month and repeatedly threatening to hold Daniel Herbert, the lead defense lawyer, in contempt.","Judge Gaughan, who is expected to finish swearing in the jurors on Monday morning, rejected each side’s claim that the other was wrongly screening jury candidates based on race.","Prosecutors used four peremptory strikes on white men, including one who has a pro-police bumper sticker on his vehicle and another who is in the process of becoming a Chicago police officer. Defense lawyers used five peremptory strikes on people who are not white, including a black man who serves as a church elder and a black woman who was filling out her jury questionnaire when she was told that her son had been shot.","Ahead of this trial, fears about what might happen afterward have been widely discussed — by defense lawyers, by members of Laquan’s family, in newspaper headlines, even by Officer Van Dyke himself.","The Rev. Marvin Hunter, Laquan’s great-uncle, who remembered the teenager as a joyful young man who liked to joke around, said the family wanted Officer Van Dyke to be convicted, but also wanted any protests to be peaceful. “I’m concerned about riots and violence,” he said.","Officer Van Dyke’s defense team has also made an issue of the potential for unrest, and has asked potential jurors if they would fear the consequences of a not-guilty verdict.","“Jurors will be reluctant to listen to the evidence and render the appropriate verdict knowing the ramifications if Mr. Van Dyke is found not guilty,” Mr. Herbert said in a recent court filing.","Laquan’s death overturned this city’s leadership, causing or contributing to the downfalls of a Chicago police superintendent, the prosecutor who waited more than a year to bring charges and, now, the mayor.","Mr. Emanuel, once one of the country’s most powerful big-city mayors, announced a day before jury selection in the Van Dyke case that he would not seek a third term as mayor. His staff has said that the decision had nothing to do with the trial; still, Laquan’s death left its mark on the mayor’s nearly eight years in office.","The case against Officer Van Dyke has led to policy changes here. All patrol officers have been equipped with Tasers and body cameras, rules for when officers can shoot have been tightened and, on Thursday, city officials agreed to a court-enforced consent decree that would require an overhaul of the Police Department.","Trust in the Chicago police remains elusive, though, and new police shootings continue to lead to protests. Activists say that even if Officer Van Dyke is convicted of murder, which could lead to a life sentence in prison, systemic problems remain unsolved.","“I don’t think the buck stops with one officer going to jail,” said William Calloway, who has helped organize protests outside the courthouse, “not when you have hundreds of police shootings through the years.”","An earlier version of this article misspelled in one instance the surname of the director of the Center for Criminal Defense at Northwestern University’s law school. He is Jeffrey Urdangen, not Undragen.",,,,,Advertisement
