Tele_Prompter,Trumpers were against: Presidents golfing, until Trump did it. Executive orders, until Trump did it. Mishandling classified info, until Trump did it. Government corruption, until Trump did it. And they said taking the 5th is a sign of guilt, until Trump does it. It's how sheep roll!
Tele_Prompter,The Trump administration just quietly waived punishment for 5 banks whose affiliates were convicted in an interest rate scheme. One of the banks that got a waiver was Deutche Bank -- which Trump owes at least $130 million to | IB Times
Tele_Prompter,Ted Lieu (Member of Congress): "You & your attorney Michael Cohen do not constitute 'our country.' The American people do. What the US Attorney for SDNY & the judicial branch did today was not an attack on our county. It was the vindication of the Rule of Law, which our country relies on."
Tele_Prompter,Where Donald Trump thinks guns should be allowed: ✔️ Schools ✔️ Movie Theaters ❌ His Inauguration
Tele_Prompter,Joy Reid: "The FBI is part of the executive branch which you run, so presumably you know that its counterintelligence and domestic crime divisions are completely separate. And yet you would use massacre victims — dead children and teachers — to try and further obstruct the justice system."
Tele_Prompter,It’s been clear for decades that Trump was both an asshole and a dummy; this is now a problem not just for the odd unlucky cocktail waitress and his staff of cheesy apparatchiks but literally every person on earth. | The Concourse
Tele_Prompter,David Frum: "It's incredible that a president would travel to France for this significant anniversary - and then remain in his hotel room watching TV rather than pay in person his respects to the Americans who gave their lives in France for the victory gained 100 years ago tomorrow."
Tele_Prompter,Joy Reid: "The fact that an entire political party is willing to stand by and let this dangerous game go on, for no better or more dignified reason than tax cut greed, hatred of the safety net and partisan thirst for power is incredibly depressing and worse, perilous for our democracy."
Tele_Prompter,Judd Apatow on Twitter: "I love a prosecutor who says ten women are lying about their accusations about Trump before hearing any evidence. Giuliani is dogshit."
Tele_Prompter,Trump had promised after the 9/11 attack to donate $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund. The New York City Comptroller’s Office has found no evidence that Trump donated to 9/11 charities. | ABC News
Tele_Prompter,Paul Krugman: "This isn't just political spin: Every single thing GOP says about its tax plan is a flat lie!"
Tele_Prompter,Rep. Adam Schiff: "GOP just shut down House Intel investigation, leaving questions unanswered, leads unexplored, countless witnesses uncalled, subpoenas unissued. If Russians have leverage over the President, GOP has decided that it would rather not know."
Tele_Prompter,John Huey on Twitter: "Once trump got away with no tax disclosure, pretty clear he wouldn't adhere to any other ethical custom, rule, or law. Floodgates now open."
Tele_Prompter,The saddest part of 2016 was seeing how many people believed the worst rumors about a woman while ignoring the worst facts about a man
Tele_Prompter,Elizabeth Warren: "The Washington swamp just got a little dirtier. The Senate just voted to confirm former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to be second in command at the @EPA. Now he could work to poison the agency – and the environment he's supposed to protect – for years to come."
Tele_Prompter,Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by 19 women. This is not about partisanship; this is about principle. Each of us must proclaim that this situation is over the line, that women matter, that their voices and their stories matter, that propriety, honor and character matter. | NY Times
Tele_Prompter,Trump isn’t a self-made titan of business so much as a trust-fund kid turned con artist; his administration isn’t pro-worker, only pro-boss; far from “draining the swamp,” he’s flooding it with raw sewage. | NYMag.com
Tele_Prompter,Maxine Waters: "Trump has made it clear - w/ Bannon & Gorka in the WH, & the Klan in the streets, it is now the White Supremacists' House."
Tele_Prompter,Emmy Rossum on Twitter: "Today Trump denounced protests against him, but so far nothing denouncing the KKK celebration parade in his honor."
Tele_Prompter,Trump says he can release the most classified data anytime he chooses, but can't release his tax returns due to an "audit."
Tele_Prompter,US reporters shocked when this German reporter asked Trump: "Why do keep saying things you know are not true?"
Tele_Prompter,Scott Gilmore (Boston Globe): "Yesterday, the NYT revealed the President of the United States committed hundreds of millions of dollars of tax fraud - possibly one of the biggest scandals in the history of the Presidency - and 24 hours later we're no longer talking about it."
Tele_Prompter,John Cleese: "If President Trump wants to stop 'attacks' on Judeo-Christian values, he could try embodying some, beginning with not bearing false witness"
Tele_Prompter,Maxine Waters: "Trump thinks he can distract us w/ his unhinged rants, meltdowns, and name calling at his rallies. Not me. I'm focused on his obstruction of justice, collusion w/ Russia, conspiracy, and jail time."
Tele_Prompter,Keith Boykin(CNN):"A TV game show host (Trump) married to a model (Melania) has an affair with a porn star (Stormy Daniels), hires a movie producer (Mnuchin) and a reality show star (Omarosa) while his son has an affair with a singer (Aubrey O'Day). But Democrats are the ones with Hollywood values."

wolfwolfz,I'm starting to wonder if selling btc for fiat would be even needed nowdays
wolfwolfz,To the uninitiated:
wolfwolfz,Bitstamp support disabled 2FA of a user on the request of a hacker without asking for ID or any other info, user lost his BTC? wtf Bitstamp.
wolfwolfz,NASDAQ SOURCE: "The listing of several coins will happen in 2019..." Nasdaq and Gemini have gotten very comfortable with each other. Tezos is part of Winklevosscapital, do you see Tezos on Nasdaq in 2019?
wolfwolfz,Kathleen is such a boss
wolfwolfz,How on earth is Cardano marketcap 3x more than Tezos
wolfwolfz,6 people called of the Bitcoin fork. Think about that. #Tezos
wolfwolfz,Fast forward in 2020 by Techcrunch: Tezos releases Bakestation, a plug in device for passive income through Liquid Proof of Stake with in build on-chain governance voting. I think this is a great way to get Tezos to mainstream and increasing its decentralization, should TF fund such project?

wolfwolfz,Tezcoin
wolfwolfz,.
wolfwolfz,The Tezos mission to the moon starts today, Tezos To The Moon soundtrack
wolfwolfz,Does this put Tezos at number 1 regarding on chain governance?
wolfwolfz,As someone who's still learning about Bitcoin, this is the best explanation i've seen and made me realize how big of a deal Bitcoin is
wolfwolfz,When can we vote on zk-snarks using the governance mechanism?
wolfwolfz,Tezos halving coming in January? 62.9 million XTZ will be frozen instead of todays 38.3 million
wolfwolfz,Looking at Tzscan watching the delegations in action is amazing, it's like im in the future, millions of USD worth of Cryptocurrency are being assigned from around the globe to another person in an instant to earn dividents. On a global level this starts to change things.
wolfwolfz,Looking forward to the XTZ lunch party
wolfwolfz,Ryan Jesperson talking Tezos at the CV Summit
wolfwolfz,BCH closed up meetings for protocol development show how screwed up their governance system is, their community is outrageous.

BitttBurger,This has been said before, but it needs to be said again: Cryptocurrency needs to decouple from BTC. Now.
BitttBurger,An important reminder from one of the greatest minds in Crypto.
BitttBurger,Remember: Bitcoin Cash is solving a problem Core has failed to solve for 6 years. It is urgently needed as a technical solution, and has nothing to do with "Roger" or "Jihan".
BitttBurger,Coinbase: "Give us the right to run your credit report or your account will be cancelled". Couldn't proceed past login without Accepting new User Agreement.
BitttBurger,At CHASE bank and figured, why not...
BitttBurger,"F BANKS" wasn't approved.
BitttBurger,The Bitcoin community is so far gone...
BitttBurger,San Diegans be like: “At least it’s not snowing”.
BitttBurger,Steve Jobs: "You have to start with the customer experience, and work backwards to the Technology. What benefits can we give to the customer? Not "Lets sit down with the engineers and discuss our awesome technology".
BitttBurger,No words ....
BitttBurger,Any US Citizens here moving to Puerto Rico to take advantage of the 0% Capital Gains incentive program?
BitttBurger,All the Bitcoin leaders have now told people to just use Banking, Fiat, and Credit Cards. Its tempting to assume they've been bought off by Banks. More likely they're just grossly unqualified to be running the Bitcoin project.
BitttBurger,Coinbase: "All outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those Bitcoin". Everybody needs to see this. Moving coins is reported as a taxable capital gain, even if you never cash out. I'm done with Coinbase.
BitttBurger,“I should’ve cashed out in January”
BitttBurger,Gemini shuts down BTC transfers due to insane transaction backlog. Thanks Core.
BitttBurger,3 yr old boy needs adopting.
BitttBurger,MoneyTrigz fails to raise more than $3,700 for Bitcoin.com lawsuit. Considers pulling the plug.
BitttBurger,The Moon and Venus over San Diego tonight
BitttBurger,Dear BTM owner in San Diego: Nobody's using your BTM because you're charging a 12% fee. A message to all BTM owners...
BitttBurger,Vinny Lingham: "Should Civic stay with Bitcoin or switch to Bitcoin Cash?" Results of 1,869 Votes: 63% BCH - 37% BTC
BitttBurger,In response to the massive crash in the value of the Peso, every Shop/Vendor on Ave. Revoluçion in Tijuana Mexico will be receiving these today. (Wish yBitcoin came in Spanish!)
BitttBurger,Bitcoin: Now the most expensive way to transfer money.
BitttBurger,Ask BitPay to Support Bitcoin Cash as a Payment Option
BitttBurger,New DNA Blood Test can tell you every virus you've ever had, from among the 206 viruses known to infect humans.
BitttBurger,Want consumer adoption? Make them want Bitcoin. Here's how:
BitttBurger,Anyone else noticing the new "technique" at play? Tons of new threads intentionally mentioning "BTU" in the title? Manipulative psychology to get people to disassociate BU from "BTC" in their minds entirely...
BitttBurger,Core has failed to scale Bitcoin. An entire year after its release, SegWit has failed to pass 35% adoption. SW was too little, too late, and the industry didn't want it.
BitttBurger,It arrived just in time for Christmas!
BitttBurger,Andreas Antonopoulos: If @Bitcoin twitter account has been stolen, it should be returned to its rightful owner.
BitttBurger,Even those inside Core are starting to wake up... (GitHub Conversation Excerpt)
BitttBurger,Puerto Rican’s are the nicest people...
BitttBurger,It’s so weird reading the other sub...
BitttBurger,Today I've Diversified to Ethereum
BitttBurger,Did you see Western Unions new Bitcoin Campaign? :)
BitttBurger,Authentic r/BTC'ers - Be aware that Troll accounts are filling our threads with anti-BCH rhetoric and hundreds of self-upvotes. Make sure you look for them and Vote your opinion as well.
BitttBurger,Free Bitcoin Cash bumper stickers. Lets get proactive.
BitttBurger,Eric Lombrozzo: “You kill babies, neener neener neener!”
BitttBurger,Yes, bitcoin is under attack. From high fees, slow transactions, and an unwilling dev team. Finding a solution to that isn’t an “attack”.
BitttBurger,Why I as a Merchant simply can't recommend BTC to my customers. (even though I want to)
BitttBurger,$12.50 to $0.54. Hang in there guys.
BitttBurger,When will this be fixed? I reported it nearly 9 months ago. I know others see it "properly". I want to, as well. Without a refresh.
BitttBurger,Circle: Will you be doing any prime time Television Advertising? Here's why you must!
BitttBurger,As a thank you for being banned on /r/bitcoin for no valid reason, I'd like to set up a Bitcoin Cash node.
BitttBurger,Anyone planning on protesting the Trump rally on Friday? Don't be like New Mexico.
BitttBurger,Well I guess that's it guys. Let's pack it up and head home ...
BitttBurger,Girl sends message to Dad in space using 11 cars and some creativity.
BitttBurger,It’s great to see all the technical discussion here. Because the other sub doesn’t allow it!
BitttBurger,The first level of Core copouts was "You're not paying high enough fees". The next level of Core copouts is "Dont complain. You're the ones blocking Segwit". There's no winning.
BitttBurger,"Being insanely conservative at the cost of the health of the network is the opposite of being conservative."
BitttBurger,"Bitcoin is uncorrelated with just about all other assets. Every prudent portfolio manager should thus consider it." (Erik Voorhees)
BitttBurger,Bitmain to burn 12% of BCH mining fees: "We believe Bitcoin Cash holders should profit from the growth of BCH by their continued stake in the ecosystem"
BitttBurger,Remember the narrative here: We are passionate about fixing Bitcoin. Not replacing it. Phrasing is important.
BitttBurger,Dear Core proponents: We are claiming “BCH is Bitcoin” conceptually. Not literally... yet. Understand the difference.
BitttBurger,Over 220 Bitcoin Cash bumper stickers will be on the back of 220 cars in 15 countries by next week. And that's just from Day 1. Keep the requests coming!
BitttBurger,Clarification: Is a centralized, VC funded, for-profit company really influencing Bitcoin protocol code by hiring core developers, or is that FUD?
BitttBurger,Multiple sclerosis patient walks after taking HIV drugs.
BitttBurger,Medical Marijuana Industry pouring millions into armored trucks and security vaults. Why aren't they just using Bitcoin?
BitttBurger,Over 500 upvotes on a thread mocking Bitcoin as a peer to peer cash payment system for daily, real-life, legal transactions. BTC's own followers are too ignorant to realize they're killing it.
BitttBurger,Important time sensitive BTC transaction and I've been sitting here 40 minutes without even 1 confirmation. Thanks Core.
BitttBurger,The worst anti-BCH trolls aren’t Bitcoiners. They’re Litecoiners.
BitttBurger,I wonder how long it will take for the other sub to finally realize they did too little, too late?
BitttBurger,To all those who were dicks while the price was rising:
BitttBurger,Don’t be fooled by the new Core troll narrative here: “I love BCH! Core sucks! But BCH probably shouldn’t take the bitcoin name...“
BitttBurger,Oh. Are you r/bitcoin chaps finally realizing what’s happened to your community?
BitttBurger,The Core developers are either Maliciously motivated, Grossly incompetent, or Completely out of touch. Which is it?
BitttBurger,Steve Jobs: "You have to start with the customer experience, and work backwards to the Technology. What benefits can we give to the customer? Not "Lets sit down with the engineers and discuss our awesome technology".
BitttBurger,More "Western Union" ads in DC :)
BitttBurger,Today I feel empowered.
BitttBurger,Bill Gates already has a digital payments solution in mind, and its not Bitcoin...
BitttBurger,Bitcoin Cash is Satoshi’s Bitcoin.
BitttBurger,LOL these people crack me up. Now we are the "Corporate Takeover of Bitcoin".
BitttBurger,Everyone should contact Bitstamp & other major exchanges & suggest they switch to 101 now that Coinbase has.
BitttBurger,Merchants like myself could use a Bitcoin Accepted Here badge for our stores that includes the word "Cash" in green. Can someone spearhead an official design?
BitttBurger,Satoshi wanted the Bitcoin community to vote on what the Dev team does. We are supposed to be the miners.
BitttBurger,Previously skeptical wealth management advisor be like...
BitttBurger,I think it’s time we start calling into question the qualifications of the people running the Bitcoin project.
BitttBurger,It still absolutely kills me that my bank (and accounts) are "closed" right now...
BitttBurger,Where did Bitcoin Classic suddenly appear from?
BitttBurger,Two lost puppies found. Please upvote. Instagram username (not me) for contact in image. Verification appreciated (photos on phone etc).
BitttBurger,Please vote: Vinny Lingham asks Twitter if Civic (CVC) should switch to BCH-backed platform.
BitttBurger,OpenBazaar Founder: “If you support a community which deletes thousands of comments expressing dissenting opinion, don’t talk to me about “misleading newcomers”
BitttBurger,From here forward: Employment conflict of interest should never be tolerated in the Bitcoin Dev circle again.
BitttBurger,Coinbase: "All outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those bitcoin." Everybody needs to see this. They label transfers as taxable capital gains. Even if you never cash out. I'm done with Coinbase.
BitttBurger,Bitcoin Core (BTC) is building "Commercial Banking 2.0". Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a Currency that will Bank the Unbanked, Disrupt Finance, and onboard the poorest in the world to a new financial system without 3rd parties.
BitttBurger,“I don’t mind Bitcoin Cash, I just don’t like it stealing the Bitcoin name” <— what?
BitttBurger,Seems legit...
BitttBurger,Since BitPay apparently uses Bitstamps price, merchants can now hold all income in BTC without worry!
BitttBurger,Remember back when you would've killed for the days of $260 Bitcoins?
BitttBurger,Free Bitcoin Bumper Sticker to first 500 who request.
BitttBurger,Someone should start documenting how many "Redditors for 4 days" are promoting the narrative that bitcoin should not be a cheap, frictionless currency on the other sub.
BitttBurger,Is Blockstream’s Goal to Generate Profit or Increase the Value of Bitcoin?
BitttBurger,Previously skeptical Wealth Management Advisor acknowledges post-Brexit, Bitcoins growing reputation as new asset class in his industry. (Voice mail left for me today).
BitttBurger,R3 apparently has never dealt with the Honey Badger before.
BitttBurger,An interesting set of unexpected kinks in a Bitcoin merchant transaction by a new adoptee. Circle / BitPay.
BitttBurger,ICON: Projects that liquidated to fiat should’ve raised money in fiat. We’ll diversify to many cryptos to [fund our project and] ensure the industry’s long term growth, We grow together.
BitttBurger,ICON (ICX) Partners With Massive Accounting Firm, Deloitte's Startup Advisory Group
BitttBurger,Guys don’t even bother with Giacomo. He’s so far gone in cliché Core delusion land its pointless.
BitttBurger,Circle Banning New Random Customers We Send to Them...
BitttBurger,Core devs admit Satoshi and the White Paper actually matter.
BitttBurger,Multiple new fake accounts on r/bitcoin talking to eachother insulting BCH to influence noobs.

monero-enthusiast-12,Just noticed that TPB now has an XMR donation address. Never noticed this before.
monero-enthusiast-12,ShapeShift.io need to step up their game IMO. Evercoin.com's interface is way smoother, and their max deposit is 40 XMR right now compared to 10 XMR at shapeshift. That's FOUR TIMES higher!
monero-enthusiast-12,Reminder for maximalist Bitcoin HODLers: One great reason to HODL Monero too is that Monero's codebase is 100% independent of Bitcoin's codebase.

monero-enthusiast-12,1. Is segwit on Monero's roadmap? 2. Will we ever see cross-atomic swaps between Monero <-> Bitcoin or Monero <-> Litecoin?
monero-enthusiast-12,As a Monero fan, Andreas just blew my mind. He's making the point that ASIC resistance can lead to more centralization of mining. I want to hear your thoughts. Do you agree with Andreas?

profblockchaindfw,Blockchain Candidate Becomes Colorado Governor!!! In August 2018 during his campaign, Governor Elect Jared Polis said, “The focus of our policy is to make Colorado the leader in the currently innovative blockchain companies and helping companies succeed.” His election will move blockchain forward!
profblockchaindfw,‪Breaking News: Giant Avocado threatens elections!
profblockchaindfw,Why do people still think of Bitcoin when you mention the word Blockchain? Because they don’t know any better. Here is an easy chart I found explaining the difference. Video on Blockchain in the comment section below.
profblockchaindfw,We need a LinkedIn Blockchain so we can record real vs. embellished profiles. That way we could stop unsolicited emails from “professionals enthusiasts.” This would definitely improve humanity 😎👍 however in the meantime the comic is pretty funny 😂
profblockchaindfw,Easy to Understand Graphic of Consensus Algorithms and Introduction to Consensus Algorithms to accompany it: Two for 1: https://medium.com/@professor_91038/easy-to-understand-explanation-of-consensus-algorithms-a2f81e0328f1
profblockchaindfw,Here are some of the uses of Blockchain. The Questions being; which countries will lead in their development and implementation? As a Middle East Expert-I think the following 4; UAE, Israel, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia!
profblockchaindfw,These are great 50 industries, however what about use in the ILLEGAL ARMS TRADE. We know you can confirm illegal black market weapons by tracking serial numbers & origins of location, however that is AFTER the fact. With a developed Blockchain System in place you could track these sales BEFOREHAND!
profblockchaindfw,ABC for consultants and businesses ; If your a consultant then you better be able to ask these questions and if your a business, you better be able to answer them. If the consultant doesn’t ask then get another one and if the business can’t answer, then it needs to replace the project lead.
profblockchaindfw,The Fall of the Lira, The Safety of Bitcoin and Freedom for the Turks. The future is here.
profblockchaindfw,Google's "The Good Censor" and how to Counter Balance It
profblockchaindfw,These are the questions/issues that every Blockchain Consultant needs to think about/present when discussing business opportunities with clients. On the other hand, each business must also have their own internal answers before moving forward.
profblockchaindfw,Will crash of the Turkish Lira lead to Bitcoin Investment?
profblockchaindfw,While these 30 industries are important individually, they will be even more important when integrated. Integrated locally through government support for example, (not control) and internationally as a platform for cross border peace. Already seen in the Middle East and more to follow.
profblockchaindfw,Day at the range with my G43 which is my EDC. Great stress relief and always good to practice an stay on target.
profblockchaindfw,Cooperation between Israel and the UAE in Blockchain Technology as and Indicator for Peace in the Middle East

profblockchaindfw,Introduction to Blockhain Technology through Lincoln Logs
profblockchaindfw,Machiavelli was correct and words do mean something!
profblockchaindfw,We know from which countries illegal arms flow (Saudi Arabia, China, UAE, Turkey, Pakistan etc) and we know where they originate. So why can't we build a international blockchain supply chain system that can track in whose hands (all too often terrorists) hands they end up in? We can and must!
profblockchaindfw,Iranian Bitcoin Volume as an indicator to Instability

profblockchaindfw,Diamond Supply Chain and how Blockchain can ensure the Legitimacy of your diamond
profblockchaindfw,Forex and Bitcoin Volume Comparison and Political Implications
profblockchaindfw,We constantly think about civilian uses of Blockchain Technology but what about its military application? Each one furthers innovation in respect to the other and thus we need to look at the wider view of Blockchain technology. Understanding the whole leads to future innovations (Use Cases @CSC)
profblockchaindfw,We hear separately and independently about CyberSecurity on one hand and Blockchain Technology on the other. What about the coming together of the two? We need to stop thinking of them as unique unto themselves if we want to fight 21st century cybercrime. I know that I do (Picture HCL Technologies)
profblockchaindfw,“Without Excalibur the Grail cannot be discovered” Isn't it time to go back to the basics of learning what Blockchain is, instead of just speaking about its benefits? We won't get where we want to go if we don't first understand the technology behind the concepts. #Excalibur!
profblockchaindfw,What tracking Blockchain ETF can Teach Us
profblockchaindfw,Google declares war on our futures and Blockchain and decentralization is in the center of it all
profblockchaindfw,Military Spending above Five Percent of GDP, The Middle East, and Blockchain Technology
profblockchaindfw,C3PO and AI; Star Wars as the Precursor to today's study of Artificial Intelligence!
profblockchaindfw,Great "IDC" Chart: Seems to me that all of the top 3 "use cases" can be tied together with the tracking of illegal arms. If the past three days of warfare in the Middle East doesn't show the importance of this, then I don't know what will! Exporter-Importer-Terrorists; How and Why? Track & Learn!
profblockchaindfw,Supply Chain of Arms 1:Primary source of arms=official state stocks. 2:legitimately procured arms are diverted to black market. 3:Terrorist/Criminal Organizations procure arms from corrupt elements. 4:Sold on black market 5:Used in terrorist & criminal acts. 6:create Blockchain to stop steps 2-5

BitcoinXio,/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says "Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain" and Bitcoin Core is not. If you have to censor to get people to believe you, then you have lost.
BitcoinXio,Free_Ross on Twitter: "ALL charges of murder-for-hire vs. Ross are now dropped. After almost 5 years, gov't has moved to dismiss final MD indictment based on evidence from corrupt agent now in prison."
BitcoinXio,Someone hacked the account /u/todu which was a mod here to point users to /r/bitcoin
BitcoinXio,Former /r/cryptocurrency mod: "I used to be a mod of r/cryptocurrency until they kicked me out. Now, that sub, is controlled all by mods with accounts less than 7 months old!"
BitcoinXio,Congrats: /r/btc has reached 150,000 subscribers!
BitcoinXio,DEA agent Shaun W. Bridges signed the warrant to seize the MtGox account back in 2013
BitcoinXio,Twitter continues to go downhill - flags @Bitcoin account as ‘temporarily restricted due to unusual activity’
BitcoinXio,There is a huge edit war on Wikipedia where trolls like the user "Jtbobwaysf" are trying very hard to inject the word "bcash" into Bitcoin Cash pages and reverting/editing other pages that speak factually poorly on topics such as Lightning Network, Segwit, etc.
BitcoinXio,What /r/bitcoin mods desperately don't want you to see!
BitcoinXio,/r/btc is trending on reddit today, congrats everyone!
BitcoinXio,Bitcoin Cash is upgrading on May 15 to 32MB max block limit
BitcoinXio,Cofounder and CEO of Yours, Ryan X. Charles on Twitter: "I have to come out of the closet about something. I read r/btc, not r/bitcoin. Would rather have low quality than censorship."
BitcoinXio,Roger Ver on Twitter: "/r/Bitcoin is completely censored and has been for nearly 3 years now. I’ll donate $250K USD to the charity of Reddit’s choice if they simply appoint mods that allow people to actually discuss Bitcoin on /r/Bitcoin"
BitcoinXio,Please read our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
BitcoinXio,/r/DarkNetMarkets shut down by Reddit
BitcoinXio,Neil deGrasse Tyson: “If pundits tells you something is true, and you don’t have the critical thinking skills to evaluate their statements, then you are putty in their hands, as they shape your world view to their will.”
BitcoinXio,A little holiday humor 🎄🎅
BitcoinXio,Nicholas Merten on Twitter: “It’s really sad to see people accusing me of getting paid or “selling my soul” in crypto by simply taking a photo with Roger Ver. I don’t mean to insult anyone or start conflict, but the sheer disconnect and tribalism of some who’ve joined crypto post-2017 is surreal.”
BitcoinXio,Just a heads up on what is going on in this sub - please be aware of what is happening. There is a coordinated effort by a specific group to undermine and destroy everything that we support because they are about to lose power come mid-November.
BitcoinXio,Frances Coppola on Twitter: “Congratulations, Blockstream, you have just reinvented the interbank lending market.”
BitcoinXio,False Flags, Vote Manipulation, and Trolls
BitcoinXio,Reddit's /r/btc Reaches 100,000+ Subscribers in a Victory for Censorship Resistance
BitcoinXio,PSA: The sub has been under attack by various bad actors since it's inception. Always think independently and critically when reading posts here.
BitcoinXio,"If blockchains were only usable by the rich, then the whole [crypto] space would be much less interesting." - Vitalik Buterin
BitcoinXio,Twitter Cancels @Bitcoin Account as its CEO Invests in Competing Lightning Network. Is a conflict of interest at play? | Finance Magnates News Article
BitcoinXio,The @Bitcoin account has been suspended (again) by @TwitterSupport only because Core trolls constantly submit fake reports about it. @Jack why do you guys keep letting this happen? Instead of suspending all the fake scammer accounts you suspend the real ones. WTF.
BitcoinXio,Bitcoin Cash Mega Thread
BitcoinXio,Dear extortionist: /r/btc will not be blackmailed by you
BitcoinXio,Kim Dotcom on Twitter: “Must read: The Bitcoin Cash philosophy by @Falkvinge. [...] Our dream. It’s happening 😎”
BitcoinXio,Friendly reminder: if you haven't yet, watch this video which shows reddit is gamed and manipulated by professional shills paid by companies with huge million dollar budgets. It is up to our community to defend itself against these bad actors.
BitcoinXio,NodeCounter switches from Slush pool to Bitcoin.com Mining Pool in support of Bitcoin Unlimited
BitcoinXio,Kraken CEO Jesse Powell regarding Exchange BU Statement: "looks like some changes were made to this document after we put our name on it. not cool. we don't agree with everything represented there."

BitcoinXio,Gavin's new commentary on Wright situation in email with Dan Kaminsky
BitcoinXio,Coinbase update: We have observed consensus in the community that the BCH ABC chain will retain the designation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Coinbase will also adopt this designation for BCH.
BitcoinXio,How Craig Wright is attempting to dishonestly take over the Bitcoin network
BitcoinXio,The whole point of Bitcoin is to usurp govts & banks and empower people to give them financial freedom. You can’t do that with a tiny network that fights against mass adoption. The smaller the network the easier it’s captured. Bitcoin Cash is the future that I’m fighting for now.
BitcoinXio,Ryan X. Charles on Twitter: The censorship of /r/bitcoin has had a real, negative effect. A lot of beginners are confused and mislead about the issues.
BitcoinXio,What /r/Bitcoin mods desperately don't want you to see (again, and again)
BitcoinXio,Brian Armstrong on Twitter: "My hope is that we start to see hard forks as an elegant upgrade/voting mechanism, not something to be feared that results in multiple coins"
BitcoinXio,Governor Jesse Ventura wrote on Twitter: "Thank you @rogerkver for explaining #bitcoin to me."

BitcoinXio,Roger Ver on Twitter: "Carl Mark Force and other govt agents infiltrated the Silk Road by getting admin status all the way back in 2012. Perhaps the censorship imposing mods Bashco and Theymos on /r/Bitcoin are just government agents intentionally delaying crypto currency adoption."

BitcoinXio,Coinbase on Twitter: (1/3) Coinbase has re-enabled sends/receives of BCH on Coinbase Pro, Prime, http://Coinbase.com and the iOS and Android apps. We expect to enable full BCH trading and functionality, including buys/sells on http://Coinbase.com , in the next 2 days.
BitcoinXio,I was one of the first people to buy @aantonop’s Mastering Bitcoin books back in the day (that he personally signed). I’m a long time fan of his but super disappointed that of all people he is now pushing his own propaganda and self-censorship.
BitcoinXio,/r/Bitcoin is brigading TrustPilot to give Bitcoin.com bad ratings (it's full of fake reviews).
BitcoinXio,Chandler Guo's Mining Pool to Support Bitcoin Unlimited
BitcoinXio,It’s mind boggling to hear people say Bitcoin blocks should be so small that you can run full nodes on tiny hard drives to self-validate txs but in the same vein think $100 tx fees are okay. I highly doubt these same people are even validating their own txs w/such high fees.
BitcoinXio,Kim Dotcom on Twitter: "Every #Megaupload file transfer will be linked to a tiny #Bitcoin micro transaction. Get ready for Bitcache."

BitcoinXio,A diff of the Exchange Hardfork Statement copy and the signed copy showing removed text that was taken out/changed
BitcoinXio,I’ve never encountered such a hateful/jealous group like BTC maximalists. They will do anything to disparage others or any project that competes w/ BTC. They are misogynistic, ridicule people who help others, they troll constantly & have THE most toxic community in all of crypto.
BitcoinXio,Bitcoin.com under DDoS attack today (easily mitigated). Someone doesn’t want Bitcoin Cash to succeed. I wonder who? 🤔
BitcoinXio,CobraBitcoin: "Lightning is cool, but nobody should be recommending it to actual merchants for at least the next few years. Merchants like Steam already got hurt by adopting Bitcoin and regretting it later. Lightning needs time to mature and prove itself. Mad hype to rush adoption will harm it."
BitcoinXio,If people are wondering why there are not more companies supporting big blocks, the recent smear campaign shows why (Post by Thomas Zander on Bitcoin Forum)
BitcoinXio,Core supporter BitUsher let's it slip on what every Bitcoin Cash supporter says almost daily: Lightning Network is unproven and untested and nobody knows how it will work. Makes total sense to test it out on a multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency. /s
BitcoinXio,~632 users here now on /r/btc
BitcoinXio,/r/bitcoin has now turned on Bitcoin.org, trying to destroy Cobra Bitcoin's rep - typical Core propaganda now being used against one of their own
BitcoinXio,Bullish: ShapeShift Most Popular Trade in the last 24 hours (BTC to BCH)

BitcoinXio,Blockchain CEO Peter Smith on Twitter: "We've dedicated our lives to building bitcoin products, introduced millions to bitcoin, evangelized, long before it was cool. Enemies?" (in response to Adam Back)

MemoryDealers,Tigerdirect.com is considering accepting Bitcoin! Help push them to do so!
MemoryDealers,I'm Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com and world's first investor in Bitcoin startups. AMA
MemoryDealers,The pro Bitcoin Cash video from CNBC made it to the very front page of Yahoo.com!
MemoryDealers,I (Roger Ver) will be doing an AMA on Monday Dec 18th starting at 10AM EST on /r/BTC because /r/Bitcoin is completely censored.
MemoryDealers,Reminder: Blockstream and Core got 100% of everything they asked for.
MemoryDealers,I'm giving away $100 each of BCH and BTC on live TV tomorrow by displaying the private key. Guess why?
MemoryDealers,How wrong were they? More than 2 years ago the CEO of Lightning Labs said LN would be ready in less than 6 months
MemoryDealers,To the Censorship loving tyrants in /r/Bitcoin, don't Say Bitcoin.com didn't warn you! "In the unlikely event that the 2MB block size increase portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively."
MemoryDealers,Sign the Petition for Clemency for Ross Ulbricht, Serving Double Life for a Website
MemoryDealers,The largest Q&A website in Japan, with 40M+ monthly visitors, has now integrated Bitcoin tipping for all their users!
MemoryDealers,I just bet 1,000 BTC (~$4M USD) that Segwit 2X coin will have more value than Segwit 1x coin.
MemoryDealers,If you think consumers are going to throw away $100’s (and soon $1000’s) on transaction fees to open up a payment channel on the Lightning network, you are delusional.
MemoryDealers,PSA: If you get an email from me (Roger Ver) asking to borrow BTC, you can be 100% sure it as a scam. If they ask to borrow BCH, it is more plausible, but still a scam.
MemoryDealers,Ross Ulbricht turns 34 on March 27. It's his fifth birthday spent in a cage.
MemoryDealers,How to destroy Bitcoin
MemoryDealers,BTC Supporters........
MemoryDealers,Here is someone sending Andreas Antonopoulos a tip of $1.50.They ended up paying $13.46 in transaction fees.

MemoryDealers,Bitcoin Cash is spreading in Tokyo! (Because it actually works)
MemoryDealers,Fun Fact: Bitcoin.com is adding over 10,000 new users per day and all of them are getting Bitcoin Cash wallets.
MemoryDealers,Bitcoin.com is now a top 4,000 website in the world!
MemoryDealers,Message to Theymos
MemoryDealers,In 2013 everyone knew that Bitcoin could scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second on chain.
MemoryDealers,When you invite someone to do a video interview, and then refuse to release the video, that makes you a fraud Dennis.
MemoryDealers,I think many of you were not around back in 2011 when I started paying for this national radio advertisement on more than 100 radio stations across the country. According to the Core trolls I'm someone who wants to destroy Bitcoin.
MemoryDealers,"So no worries, Ethereum's long term value is still ~0." -Greg Maxwell, CTO of Blockstream and opponent of allowing Bitcoin to scale as Satoshi had planned.
MemoryDealers,If you are confused between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core in the Bitcoin.com wallet, you are a liar or mentally handicapped.

MemoryDealers,High Bitcoin Tx Fee Problem Solved! (Thanks Blockstream!)
MemoryDealers,1,000,000 Bitcoin Cash wallets have now been created thanks to Bitcoin.com

MemoryDealers,The double standard at /r/Bitcoin on full display:
MemoryDealers,One of the top posts for the entire year of 2015 on /r/Bitcoin. (It was then censored)
MemoryDealers,"Bitcoin was originally peer to peer electronic cash, not this settlement layer that Core is pushing."
MemoryDealers,/r/BTC has surpassed 50K subscribers! (Because /r/Bitcoin is censored)
MemoryDealers,A blast from the past:
MemoryDealers,Bitcoin.com is now a top 2,000 website in the world! (Bitcoin Cash is spreading!)
MemoryDealers,No need to debate the issues when you have censorship and troll armies on your side.
MemoryDealers,As the Bitcoin.com wallet approaches 1M installs, yesterday was the first time in its history that people used it to make more BCH transactions than BTC.
MemoryDealers,If all the 32MB blocks were permanently 100% full, this $400 hard drive could store the blockchain for the next 7 years.
MemoryDealers,"I wonder if Starbucks is aware of the fact that there was quite literally a civil war over whether coffee should be on the blockchain, and that they're on the chain that doesn't want coffee."

MemoryDealers,The source of sock puppets
MemoryDealers,To the Twitter liars like Whale Panda and DarkPill claiming tonight's Tokyo event wasn't related to BCH, the reception desk was covered with BCH signs, and every single person who attended was given a BCH sticker.
MemoryDealers,HOW WRONG WERE THEY?: Tone Vays claims vehemently that Segwit will instantly fix all scaling problems. Meanwhile fees are higher than ever.
MemoryDealers,The people behind Bitcoin Cash are the ones who created Bitcoin's network effect in the first place.
MemoryDealers,r/Bitcoin subscribers are now calling for people to report Bitcoin.com to the Internet Crime Complaint Center of the FBI. It's sad that BTC supporters all seem to be statists who yell about hodling their muh store of value all day.
MemoryDealers,SBI Group Declares Bitcoin Cash True Bitcoin | BCH Japan
MemoryDealers,I’ll (Roger Ver) be in the L.A. area in Nov and would love the chance to set the record straight with Joe Rogan on the real state of Bitcoin.
MemoryDealers,Amaury, creator of Bitcoin Cash, has been banned from the Bitcoin Cash Slack
MemoryDealers,"Today /r/bitcoin is still deleting around 6,000-7,000 comments and posts per month in a desperate attempt to control and manipulate the narrative"
MemoryDealers,I gave away $10 in BTC on Jimmy Song's live stream, and all the Core supporter received was $2 thanks to the fees.

BitcoinXio,/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says "Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain" and Bitcoin Core is not. If you have to censor to get people to believe you, then you have lost.

BitcoinXio,Please read our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
BitcoinXio,/r/DarkNetMarkets shut down by Reddit
BitcoinXio,Neil deGrasse Tyson: “If pundits tells you something is true, and you don’t have the critical thinking skills to evaluate their statements, then you are putty in their hands, as they shape your world view to their will.”
BitcoinXio,A little holiday humor 🎄🎅
BitcoinXio,Nicholas Merten on Twitter: “It’s really sad to see people accusing me of getting paid or “selling my soul” in crypto by simply taking a photo with Roger Ver. I don’t mean to insult anyone or start conflict, but the sheer disconnect and tribalism of some who’ve joined crypto post-2017 is surreal.”
BitcoinXio,Just a heads up on what is going on in this sub - please be aware of what is happening. There is a coordinated effort by a specific group to undermine and destroy everything that we support because they are about to lose power come mid-November.
BitcoinXio,Frances Coppola on Twitter: “Congratulations, Blockstream, you have just reinvented the interbank lending market.”
BitcoinXio,False Flags, Vote Manipulation, and Trolls

BitcoinXio,The @Bitcoin account has been suspended (again) by @TwitterSupport only because Core trolls constantly submit fake reports about it. @Jack why do you guys keep letting this happen? Instead of suspending all the fake scammer accounts you suspend the real ones. WTF.

BitcoinXio,Kim Dotcom on Twitter: “Must read: The Bitcoin Cash philosophy by @Falkvinge. [...] Our dream. It’s happening 😎”
BitcoinXio,Friendly reminder: if you haven't yet, watch this video which shows reddit is gamed and manipulated by professional shills paid by companies with huge million dollar budgets. It is up to our community to defend itself against these bad actors.

BitcoinXio,How Craig Wright is attempting to dishonestly take over the Bitcoin network
BitcoinXio,The whole point of Bitcoin is to usurp govts & banks and empower people to give them financial freedom. You can’t do that with a tiny network that fights against mass adoption. The smaller the network the easier it’s captured. Bitcoin Cash is the future that I’m fighting for now.
BitcoinXio,Ryan X. Charles on Twitter: The censorship of /r/bitcoin has had a real, negative effect. A lot of beginners are confused and mislead about the issues.
BitcoinXio,What /r/Bitcoin mods desperately don't want you to see (again, and again)
BitcoinXio,Brian Armstrong on Twitter: "My hope is that we start to see hard forks as an elegant upgrade/voting mechanism, not something to be feared that results in multiple coins"

BitcoinXio,I was one of the first people to buy @aantonop’s Mastering Bitcoin books back in the day (that he personally signed). I’m a long time fan of his but super disappointed that of all people he is now pushing his own propaganda and self-censorship.
BitcoinXio,/r/Bitcoin is brigading TrustPilot to give Bitcoin.com bad ratings (it's full of fake reviews).
BitcoinXio,Chandler Guo's Mining Pool to Support Bitcoin Unlimited
BitcoinXio,It’s mind boggling to hear people say Bitcoin blocks should be so small that you can run full nodes on tiny hard drives to self-validate txs but in the same vein think $100 tx fees are okay. I highly doubt these same people are even validating their own txs w/such high fees.

BitcoinXio,I’ve never encountered such a hateful/jealous group like BTC maximalists. They will do anything to disparage others or any project that competes w/ BTC. They are misogynistic, ridicule people who help others, they troll constantly & have THE most toxic community in all of crypto.
BitcoinXio,Bitcoin.com under DDoS attack today (easily mitigated). Someone doesn’t want Bitcoin Cash to succeed. I wonder who? 🤔
BitcoinXio,CobraBitcoin: "Lightning is cool, but nobody should be recommending it to actual merchants for at least the next few years. Merchants like Steam already got hurt by adopting Bitcoin and regretting it later. Lightning needs time to mature and prove itself. Mad hype to rush adoption will harm it."
BitcoinXio,If people are wondering why there are not more companies supporting big blocks, the recent smear campaign shows why (Post by Thomas Zander on Bitcoin Forum)
BitcoinXio,Core supporter BitUsher let's it slip on what every Bitcoin Cash supporter says almost daily: Lightning Network is unproven and untested and nobody knows how it will work. Makes total sense to test it out on a multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency. /s
BitcoinXio,~632 users here now on /r/btc
BitcoinXio,/r/bitcoin has now turned on Bitcoin.org, trying to destroy Cobra Bitcoin's rep - typical Core propaganda now being used against one of their own

BitcoinXio,Did you know you can buy Bitcoin Cash now on Bitcoin.com?
BitcoinXio,This is a good time to focus on the fundamentals and remember why we are all here. This video by Coinbase does a great job of highlighting that.

CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Over $12B worth of LTC has been sent in the last 24hr. That's almost 95% of its marketcap. See how this stacks up against the other coins. Litecoin IS the payments coin!
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: You can now buy Steam vouchers with LTC! Thanks @bitrefill for supporting Litecoin!
CBDoctor,2 0 0
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Lightning Network is effectively Bitcoin's cache. It should rebrand to Bitcoin Cache for ultimate confusion. 😂 #bcash
CBDoctor,<--- Number of people believing in the technology behind Litecoin
CBDoctor,KFC learning about cryptocurrencies right now.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Elon, consider accepting Bitcoin for your cars. It's very easy to sign up for a @coinbase merchant account and integrate it. And there's 0 risk. Good PR too. Future of cars bought with the future of money. Think about that!
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: CNBC just called and wanted to talk to me on Squawk Box next Monday. I told them no because I was too busy. - Who am I kidding here?! Talking 🐔 on Squawk. How fitting! Sign me up! 😂
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: You can now buy Steam vouchers with LTC! Thanks @bitrefill for supporting Litecoin!
CBDoctor,@MLPFrank: The new Litecoin design overhaul is coming along great. A real emphasis on decluttering, simplifying and focusing on what really matters to users of all levels is key! - Here's to 2018.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: The Litecoin team has been hard at work working with companies to support Litecoin. Nothing to announce yet, but here's what's in the works: - Merchant processor Popular online wallet Goods trading platform One huge unexpected surprise. 😀 - 2018 will be a good year for Litecoin!
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I will let you guys in on my little secret. The reason why I post so much about Bitcoin is to get Bitcoin maximalists to follow me. Then I slowly chip away at their Highlander beliefs one tweet at a time. Before long, they will have bought some LTC and brainwashed. It works. 😜
CBDoctor,Saw this guy while watching the olympics today
CBDoctor,@Satoshilite: For the next release of Litecoin reference client, we will reduce the relay fees from 0.001 LTC/kb ($0.30/kb) to 0.00001 LTC ($0.003/kb). We hope to have that out next week. Once people are using the new relay fees, we will reduce the actual min fee to 0.0001 LTC/kb ($0.03/kb).
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I'm glad to see that the market is not overacting to this news. - You can't compare me to a CEO selling all his shares. I'm the creator. Litecoin is like my kid. I'm more invested in it than someone holding 1MM LTC. For me, it was never about the money or I would have pre-mined!😀
CBDoctor,This is a rare litecoin pepe, upvote for 2 weeks of excellent luck.

CBDoctor,Warren Buffett returns to tell us about his crypto experience so far
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Like I've said, I don't control when companies release news. Asking me daily won't make it happen faster. And the news might not even move the price. - So, instead of asking me to increase the LTC price with announcements, ask yourself what you can do to help Litecoin adoption!
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I ❤️ days like today! Not because the LTC price is up, but because I won't need to read any tweets hating on Litecoin and me. 😂 - But inevitably, there will be days when price is down and everyone and their mom will be blaming it on me. Such is the life of a coin creator. 😀
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I will be on @SquawkAlley tomorrow morning around 8:30am PST to talk about Bitcoin futures. Maybe I will mention Litecoin. 🐔🗣️ 😂
CBDoctor,@LucasNuzzi: #Bitcoin is like the internet, but we're still in 1988. - To remind myself of that, I built a Raspiblitz Bitcoin full node + Lightning using a @Raspberry_Pi and a 1988 television. We might be early, but the #LightningNetwork solves a real problem and Bitcoin is here to stay.
CBDoctor,@CheapAir: It's official! We accept #Litecoin #BitcoinCash and #Dash and of course continue to take #Bitcoin! Help us spread the word #cryptocurrency fans!
CBDoctor,@Satoshilite: Later today, I will be on a Future of Bitcoin panel in the SF Bay Area. This is an easy one for me, because the future of Bitcoin is Litecoin. :D
CBDoctor,@TheRealXinxi: Most of you may not know. Charlie actually donated millions of dollars to the Litecoin development recently.
CBDoctor,Charlie Lee will donate 250 BTC to the Litecoin Foundation if 2X Fork happen on Bitcoin Blockchain.
CBDoctor,Litecoinmarkets
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I'm excited to see Litecoin added to @zebpay exchange, one of the largest exchanges in India. This opens up Litecoin trading to 1.3 billions more people! 🚀 - I hope to see @Unocoin and others follow suit. 😀

CBDoctor,@Satoshilite: Extremely lame @bobbyclee. Bitcoin (BTC) is not an altcoin. I have explained to you multiple times that miners don't decide consensus. SMH 😞
CBDoctor,Litecoin Fees to lower by 10x in next Core Release.
CBDoctor,🙏'@SatoshiLite: For those asking, unfortunately, this means that my trade with @rogerkver will not happen. But I proposed this trade initially to help stop this contentious hardfork. I'd rather see 2x called off than me and @LTCFoundation making money off of a bad situation.'🙏

CBDoctor,@LTCFoundation: We're seeing an incredible amount of interest from businesses all over the world who want to integrate #Litecoin! Don't forget to ask the companies you do business with to let you #PayWithLitecoin. http://paywithlitecoin.co
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: A ton of good news but price does its own thing. Remember that this is a marathon not a sprint. Build it and they will come. #PayWithLitecoin
CBDoctor,Upvote the daily.
CBDoctor,@APompliano: You can now buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin on Yahoo Finance. - THE VIRUS IS SPREADING 🚀
CBDoctor,@LTCFoundation: Thanks to Singapore banks for not opening a bank account for us, we had to store all our assets as Litecoins, which makes us much richer now than converting the donations into fiat and saving them in our bank account.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Although @fluffypony was kidding here, I think it would be good for Litecoin and Monero (2 of the top non-scam coins 😄) to work together. A while back, I proposed to him that we work on making it easy for people to do on-chain atomic swaps of LTC and XMR in a decentralized way.
CBDoctor,@TheRealXinxi: @SatoshiLite sold his LTC because he wants to show that he works for Litecoin not to pump it but for the good of the community. I’ve been hodling since 2013 and will keep doing so for quite long time because of my confidence in the team and the community. Don’t misunderstand
CBDoctor,Coinbase added 100k new users on Thanksgiving - We are still not mentioned on their Frontpage !
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: The Litecoin team has been hard at work working with companies to support Litecoin. Nothing to announce yet, but here's what's in the works: - Merchant processor Popular online wallet Goods trading platform One huge unexpected surprise. 😀 - 2018 will be a good year for Litecoin!
CBDoctor,LTC⚡BTC
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Ever since MtGox announced Litecoin support in 2013 and failed to deliver, I've been on a mission to get LTC added to exchanges to help increase liquidity. - With the launch of LTC on Gemini today, every single major Bitcoin exchange supports Litecoin. Mission accomplished! 🚀🌕
CBDoctor,Litecoinmarkets
CBDoctor,@TheRealXinxi: I see Litecoin will get massive adoption and go mainstream in 2018.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I'm not going anywhere. I'm still going to the moon with Litecoin. 😀
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I'm excited to see @iPayment_Inc team up with @AliantPayment and open up Litecoin and Bitcoin payments to over 137,000 businesses! 🚀 #PayWithLitecoin
CBDoctor,@Satoshilite: Craig Wright inadvertently admitted that he's not Satoshi Nakamoto. Lol #rekt. 😂
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Yes, I'm more bullish on Litecoin than ever. Bullish on adoption. Price will fix itself when adoption happens.
CBDoctor,@LTCFoundation: Litecoin transaction number is increasing fast recently and has reached all time high. All statistics are showing that Litecoin is getting more and more adoption.
CBDoctor,@LucasNuzzi: #Bitcoin is like the internet, but we're still in 1988. - To remind myself of that, I built a Raspiblitz Bitcoin full node + Lightning using a @Raspberry_Pi and a 1988 television. We might be early, but the #LightningNetwork solves a real problem and Bitcoin is here to stay.
CBDoctor,@LTCFoundation: We have a few part time volunteer marketing guys. And we are looking for a full-time marketing person to lead. Then we will have a great team including a full-time lead dev @SatoshiLite and @thrasher_au, a full-time operation guy Keith, and a full-time marketing person.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Please stop asking me to announce something to help the price. Didn't I say 2018? Also, up to the respective companies to announce Litecoin support, not me. Just like how @Bitso announced LTC trading today. - About rumors, I am not aware of any Amazon or Facebook partnerships.
CBDoctor,Litecoin turns 6 today! Let us all remember why and how Litecoin was created.
CBDoctor,@satoshilite: Miners and business cannot change Bitcoin without user consensus. So today, to show my disapproval, I'm adding [NO2X] to my name. Join me!
CBDoctor,@DougPolkPoker: We are officially set to go for tomorrow's podcast, our guest will be Litecoin founder Charlie Lee @SatoshiLite ! - We will begin at 3:30 pm PT. Let me know what topics you'd like to hear us discuss below.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Litecoin is 99% dominant in Scrypt PoW. LTC has network hashrate of 301 TH/s. The next largest non-merged-mined Scrypt coin (GAME) only has 2 TH/s. Takes less than 1% of the LTC network to 51% attack other Scypt coins. But miners won't attack Litecoin and kill their cash chikun.
CBDoctor,@LTCPayCom: We’ve got more than 150 signups during the past several days.
CBDoctor,@joaodealmeida94: Looks like we are close to the first mainnet version to be released by @lightning! - People aren't ready for what's coming ⚡️
CBDoctor,Litecoinmarkets
CBDoctor,Upvote the daily.
CBDoctor,@litecoin: Congrats @lightning! The beta is now live on the Bitcoin and Litecoin mainnet! 🎊⚡️🎉
CBDoctor,Finally setup my own RaspiBlitz bitcoin Fullnode + Lightning Network thanks to the Github tutorial provided by rootzoll!
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Litecoin is now one of the 5 cryptocurrencies tracked by @Cointelegraph price index. We've finally made it! 😀😂
CBDoctor,Price Drop, don’t PANIC! Follow these steps
CBDoctor,@LTCFoundation: @RevolutApp will have LTC on Thursday! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
CBDoctor,Guy at the Senate hearing dressed as Charlie Lee’s Twitter avatar.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: The team at @LTCFoundation pulled together all the resources in one place to help businesses accept Litecoin so people can #PayWithLitecoin everywhere money is accepted! 🚀 - Next time someone asks you how they can accept LTC, refer them to http://www.paywithlitecoin.co/
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: Roger, let's debate, me and you!
CBDoctor,@JStefanop1: We did it! One month late, sleepless nights, and a few heart attacks later...here is the first production version of the #FuturuBit Apollo #LTC #ASIC #HomeMiner straight off the line. Super proud to be producing the world’s most effecient scrypt miner, and first true home miner!
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: It's strange to see people claiming that Bitcoin and Litecoin are dead because the price is so low at $8000 and $140 respectively. A year ago, the price was around $1800 and $30. Back then, people would have killed for today's prices! 🤔
CBDoctor,Setting up my new LTC mining/collocation farm :) Will update when we have some miners on the shelves!
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: You can now buy/sell LTC on @YahooFinance. Mass adoption is achieved one step at a time. 🐔🚀
CBDoctor,@LTCFoundation: Bloomberg is to add Litecoin.
CBDoctor,@exchange_union: ⚡BREAKING⚡ - #Bitcoin exchanged for #Litecoin between two exchanges - instantly and trustlessly at #LightningHackday by @sangaman
CBDoctor,Critical Electrum vulnerability
CBDoctor,Litecoinmarkets
CBDoctor,Charlie Lee: Bullish on Bitcoin And Litecoin Long Term, Short Term Impossible To Predict
CBDoctor,Something is missing
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: On the heels of @TapJets accepting Litecoin, I just got confirmation that @SurfAir is also accepting LTC now in addition to BTC and ETH. More info on this next week! 🚀 More places to #PayWithLitecoin.
CBDoctor,Upvote the daily
CBDoctor,@MLPFrank: Looking to hire people who can make sending #Litecoin payments over SMS a reality. Message me if interested and lets bring Litecoin to more people.
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: In lite of recent 51% attacks and http://crypto51.app info, rest assured that the Litecoin is extremely secure and mining is very healthy. 👍🚀
CBDoctor,@SatoshiLite: I will be on the Glenn Beck TV show today at 5pm ET. It will be mostly about Bitcoin futures and how that affect things, but maybe I will also mention Litecoin. We'll see!

JobDestroyer,HEY! Listen!
JobDestroyer,It's Monday. This stupid bill to essentially ban Bitcoin is in committee. We need to make sure it never leaves committee.
JobDestroyer,True love.
JobDestroyer,Linux errors in a nutshell
JobDestroyer,We did it!
JobDestroyer,first world anarchists.
JobDestroyer,He's a boss.
JobDestroyer,It's hard being right when the world is wrong, but these kids are tough enough to handle it.
JobDestroyer,Linux beards
JobDestroyer,Google "Democide"
JobDestroyer,It's Monday. This stupid bill to essentially ban Bitcoin is in committee. We need to make sure it never leaves committee.
JobDestroyer,Closing programs in Windows and Linux
JobDestroyer,Fun fact: 40 percent of police families experience domestic violence. Not all cops are bad, but enough are that we should definitely be ARMED.
JobDestroyer,How, exactly, would he do that without a gun?
JobDestroyer,Real men do what is right.
JobDestroyer,People are openly calling for the death of gun-owners, yet you TOTALLY don't need a gun for *SELF DEFENSE!*
JobDestroyer,huh, and no one got shot. Amazing!
JobDestroyer,I think we should spend more time focusing on the racist roots of gun confiscation.
JobDestroyer,Why does everything use MTP these days? MTP sucks.
JobDestroyer,We have the worlds largest military in the USA. We have wars in so many countries that we can't even count them. Soon, 17 year olds will be joining the army and deploying to Afghanistan who weren't even *alive* on 9/11. Really want to say our government isn't capable of tyranny? PROTECT THE 2ND!
JobDestroyer,The MarchAgainstTrump subreddit is suddenly anti-war, so here's a reminder to everyone here: The Libertarian Party is the *only* political party that has *always* been anti-war since the foundation of the party. If you ever see anyone who supported Hillary or Obama or Trump, remind them of this.
JobDestroyer,(repost of something I posted a while back) Sure, you can get to L2.
JobDestroyer,Russia engaged in electoral interventions of foreign states 81 times according to data.
JobDestroyer,I think we need a new celebrity spokesperson, I suggest Jenna Jameson take the spot. :P
JobDestroyer,Liberty in North Korea: Bitcoin.com, /r/GoldAndBlack Team Up for Worthy Cause - Bitcoin News

JobDestroyer,This is pretty much how it went down in NY.

JobDestroyer,John McAfee - "But all of these issues are becoming moot. It is clear that crypto-currencies will soon be the defacto standards of the world’s money. The Fed will disappear due simply to the issue of relevancy."
JobDestroyer,Compiz: What the hell happened to it? Is there something to replace it?
JobDestroyer,Venezuela Raises Minimum Wage 3,000% and Lots of Workers Get Fired
JobDestroyer,10 Guns
JobDestroyer,We had to remove an image someone posted that contained a 3d printable gun file.
JobDestroyer,Every time this happens, the militia grows stronger. Every time the militia grows stronger, the US becomes safer. We'll win in the end.
JobDestroyer,p. much
JobDestroyer,How I feel as a modern libertarian
JobDestroyer,Google the word "Democide"
JobDestroyer,The effects of hyperinflation in Zimbabwe.
JobDestroyer,TIL that WWE wrestler Kane gives talks on economics to nursing homes.
JobDestroyer,My husband, Rand Paul, and our family have suffered intimidation and threats
JobDestroyer,Let's say that the gun-grabbers are right, and that banning guns would prevent mass shootings. 262 MILLION people were murdered by their own governments in the 20th century. If those democides are prevented by a well-armed population, it's still worth it for us to be ARMED.

JobDestroyer,Wouldn't this sub be served to develop it's own community based on it's own merits, instead of only complaining about /r/bitcoin?
JobDestroyer,when you're asked for tech support
JobDestroyer,College is important.
JobDestroyer,Please refrain from downvoting in this subreddit.
JobDestroyer,this tool just saved me several hours of bullshit.
JobDestroyer,First Pizza Hut is fixing the roads, now Minute Maid is providing legal defense to children getting gigged for not having business permits.
JobDestroyer,When your socialism isn't fake yet (x-post /r/QualitySocialism)
JobDestroyer,We have 15,000 members!
JobDestroyer,there you go.
JobDestroyer,Cops Break Into Innocent Man's Home, Taser Him to Death in the Shower—No Charges
JobDestroyer,It's Monday. This stupid bill to essentially ban Bitcoin is in committee. We need to make sure it never leaves committee.
JobDestroyer,We’re Still Fighting In Afghanistan And No One Cares
JobDestroyer,Watching these people tear their hair out makes me so happy. Seriously, for all the bullshit I had to go through when I was a NY gun owner, I'd like to thank Cody Wilson and everyone else at Defense Distributed for the best possible vengence and the best possible solution to the gun control debate.
JobDestroyer,Absolute poverty levels as of 2016; good map for when people want to tax the rich when you want to illustrate that they *are* the rich.
JobDestroyer,On /r/CapitalismVSocialism, someone asks when killing civilians is okay. Communist responds, "Frankly, I am fine with killing civilians if they are harming the proletariat or the Revolution. "
JobDestroyer,Libertarian Dad Jokes
JobDestroyer,Being rebellious means loving the government more than you love liberty itself.
JobDestroyer,Let's take a moment to talk about one of the more niche things the government bans: Dueling. What sort of problems could be solved if you just gave the two parties flintlock pistols and told them to take 20 paces?
JobDestroyer,Tao Te Ching; written over 2,500 years ago.

JobDestroyer,/r/RandPaul is trending. With Rand recently deciding he is a libertarian again, this hopefully means the libertarian message is resonating with people.
JobDestroyer,I took a study that demonstrated that the US interfered with elections 81 times, changed "US" to "Russia" in the headline, and submitted it to "The_Mueller". 315 upvotes so far for very very fake news.
JobDestroyer,aaaaaaaaaaaaaactually
JobDestroyer,Just got this new book...
JobDestroyer,Arguably the best error message of all time.
JobDestroyer,We have 15k subscribers. If this post gets 15k upvotes, then this subreddit will become a "Why not both?"-themed subreddit.
