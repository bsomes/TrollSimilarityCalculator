The cell phone footage shows the police shooting at Dylan Noble, 19, as he lies on the ground during a traffic stop in Fresno, California, on June 24.","According to the police, they received reports that a man was driving a pickup truck and carrying a rifle. Dylan was stopped at a Fresno gas station and asked to come out of his truck with his hands up.",Police officers are heard yelling at the 19-year old “let us see what you got” and ‘keep your hands up” before one opens fire. They are quickly joined by two more cops who aim their guns at Dylan who is lying bleeding on the ground. An officer was heard to warn him again before another shot was fired.,"Fresno police confirmed the teen was shot four times – twice before the footage and twice during. Police chief Jerry Dyer claims the teen was shot when he tried to reach for his waistband. He also said the officers’ body cam footage showed the entire incident, though it hasn’t been released to the public yet as investigations are still ongoing.",No weapons were found at the scene.,"Dylan was rushed to a hospital, but died in surgery. His family’s Attorney has requested to review the video in the case, and asked that an independent authority investigate the shooting."

    ",Strategy Room: Jessica Tarlov and Brian Morgenstern discuss backlash to Obama administrations letter telling public schools to let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice,"The Obama administration&aposs directive Friday that every public school provide transgender access -- or face the loss of federal funds -- drew swift and strong condemnation from conservatives, with one public official blasting it as presidential ""blackmail.""",The administration’s directive -- citing Title IX in telling schools to give transgender students access to all activities and facilities consistent with their gender identity -- effectively touched off a national debate that could well extend into the next president’s term and reverberate through the courts.,"Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, speaking to reporters Friday, said his state “will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States.”","""This goes against the values of so many people,"" he added. ""This has everything to do with keeping the federal government out of local issues.""",White House spokesman Josh Earnest later defended the letter as “guidance” that was requested by schools across the country and said it “does not add any additional requirements under the law.”,He also pushed back on Patrick’s comments that the letter was “blackmail.”,"“This does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to statewide office,” Earnest said, referring to Patrick’s talk radio show.","Patrick -- highlighting the impact of a growing debate that has centered on who should or should not use gender-specific bathrooms, but could extend well beyond that -- called this the ""biggest issue facing families and schools in America since prayer was taken out of public schools.” The guidance could open a Pandora’s box of related issues, from whether colleges would be forced to consider gender identity in student housing assignments to how administrators handle preferences for sports teams and locker rooms, and more. ",The letter the administration sent to school districts was signed by officials at the Justice Department and the Department of Education. A copy was posted on the Department of Justice’s website.,"While the letter does not have the force of law, it does warn that schools that do not abide by the administration’s interpretation of civil rights under the Title IX law may face lawsuits or loss of federal aid.","""There is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement.","Patrick scoffed at the threat, saying the feds can keep their ""30 pieces of silver.""","Officials say the letter is meant to clarify expectations of school districts that receive funding from the federal government. Educators have been seeking guidance on how to comply with Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs and activities that receive federal funding, Education Secretary John B. King said in a statement.","“No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,” King said. “We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from, they have the opportunity to get a great education in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and violence.”","Under the guidance, schools are told they must treat transgender students according to their chosen gender identity as soon as a parent or guardian notifies the district that that identity ""differs from previous representations or records.""","There is no obligation for a student to present a specific medical diagnosis or identification documents that reflect his or her gender identity, and equal access must be given to transgender students even in instances when it makes others uncomfortable, according to the directive.","""As is consistently recognized in civil rights cases, the desire to accommodate others&apos discomfort cannot justify a policy that singles out and disadvantages a particular class of students,"" the guidance says.","But Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, says the federal government needs to butt out of state matters. ","“What the president needs to do is focus on his job and his job is not to intervene in state and local affairs under our constitutional scheme so frankly I think his involvement in this is unwelcomed,” Cornyn said. “This ought to be a choice made by local officials at the local level held accountable by their own voters.”","The administration also released a separate 25-page document of questions and answers about best practices, including ways schools can make transgender students comfortable in the classroom and protect the privacy rights of all students in restrooms or locker rooms.","The move was cheered by Human Rights Campaign, a gay, lesbian and transgender civil rights organization, which called the guidelines ""groundbreaking.""","""This is a truly significant moment not only for transgender young people but for all young people, sending a message that every student deserves to be treated fairly and supported by their teachers and schools,"" HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement.","Earlier this week, the Justice Department and the state of North Carolina filed dueling lawsuits over the state’s controversial “bathroom” law, which had been at the center of the national debate.","In their suit, the DOJ alleged a “pattern or practice of employment discrimination on the basis of sex” against the state over the law requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate.","Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, in his lawsuit, accused the administration of a “baseless and blatant overreach” in trying to get the policy scrapped.","""This is an attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws in a manner that is wholly inconsistent with the intent of Congress and disregards decades of statutory interpretation by the Courts,"" the state’s suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of North Carolina, said.",The Associated Press contributed to this report.,"This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

"Whenever a new cryptocurrency suddenly enters the top 10 ranked by market cap, there is always a concern that it could be part of an elaborate pump-and-dump cycle. Although the jury is still out on whether or not the Tron price was heavily pumped, the currency is losing ground pretty quickly. Just a few days ago, the Tron price was close to US$0.26, whereas it is now headed below US$0.14. It seems this flavor of the week is running out of steam pretty quickly.","For those unaware of what Tron is or does, the project positions itself as an open-source decentralized content entertainment protocol. The team aims to build a free worldwide content entertainment protocol using blockchain and distributed storage technologies. Although this concept sounds interesting, there is very little code to back up any of these aspirations right now. It is not uncommon for currencies to rise in value based on hype and speculation alone, though.","Over the past few weeks, we have seen Tron enter the cryptocurrency top 10 ranked by market cap. After the Tron price got inflated rather massively, its value even peaked at US$0.279. That’s quite a steep value for a project that is merely based on a whitepaper right now with no real working product to speak of. No one doubts the developers are working hard to bring this technology to market, but for now, we have to deal with the situation at hand. ","Moreover, it seems most of Tron’s “announcements” have to do with getting listed on new exchanges. It’s good to see trading platforms show an interest in TRX, but all of this further confirms that a hype cycle is determining the Tron price first and foremost. The latest “big” announcement involved Cobinhood adding a TRX trading market come January 12. That isn’t necessarily the sort of thing that will help a decentralized entertainment content system develop. Even so, people are still willing to pay US$0.14 per token right now.",,"One thing this altcoin has working in its favor is that there’s plenty of trading volume. More specifically, Tron has seen US$1.22 billion worth of trades in the past 24 hours, which is more than most other altcoins these days. At the same time, it seems most people are interested in selling first and foremost. With the price having dropped by 12.07% against USD, 8.46% against BTC, and 17.59% against ETH, things are not looking all that great for TRX holders. ","The majority of Tron’s current trading volume is coming from Binance’s BTC and ETH markets. There’s also one fiat currency-based market among the top 3, which is Coinnest. Unsurprisingly, it’s South Korean traders who are keeping the Tron price well above US$0.14 for now, as it’s trading at US$0.1813 on Coinnest. It’s unclear why CoinMarketCap.com doesn’t exclude this exchange’s price, as it has done so for all other KRW trading pairs in the past two days. Western exchanges all trade Tron well below US$0.14 right now.","Depending on how one looks at the charts, things either look bullish or extremely worrisome for the Tron price right now. Given the currency’s past value of US$0.05 a week ago, the current price is still bullish. However, ever since the mega-pump ran out of steam, there has been zero interest in keeping the Tron price above US$0.15. The current price represents a near-50% retracement over the past five days, which is anything but positive. It will be rather interesting to see how things play out for this altcoin in the coming days. "
"Yes, it’s driven by greed — but the mania for cryptocurrency could wind up building something much more important than wealth.","By STEVEN JOHNSONJAN. 16, 2018
",layer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maid,"The sequence of words is meaningless: a random array strung together by an algorithm let loose in an English dictionary. What makes them valuable is that they’ve been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they’re known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps.","On the screen, I’m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:",1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66,"This is what’s called a “private key” in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there’s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.","That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:",0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9,That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.,"Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction — say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum — that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of “blocks” of data, that record is called the blockchain.","The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening — something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I’ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.",Advertisement,"And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum’s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.","Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one “coin” of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.","You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether’s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn’t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?","But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it’s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.","The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet’s roots.",Advertisement,"Once the inspiration for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia — there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems — but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress.","Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. “We have to fix the internet,” Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs’s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. “After 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.” The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: “The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.” In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: “Publishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google’s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.” (Full disclosure: Burnham’s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where “misinformation, or ‘fake news,’ which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.”","For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools — turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media — or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft’s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware — the web, open-source software and Apple products — that helped undermine Microsoft’s dominant position.","The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today’s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.","That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.","To some students of modern technological history, the internet’s fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, “The Master Switch,” all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon — and indirectly, Apple — what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism.","Blockchain advocates don’t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.","To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet’s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services — Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter — that largely came to power in the following decade.",Advertisement,"The first layer — call it InternetOne — was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don’t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don’t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don’t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don’t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.","To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pokémon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.","But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.","But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it’s a problem we don’t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.","The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-’90s, we’ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 — many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms — were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.","For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined — pages, links, messages — but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online.","This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It’s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as “base-layer” infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don’t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities — most of them backed by the power of the state — that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.","The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call “increasing returns” or “network effects” kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world’s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today — and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.",Advertisement,"If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there’s less reason to fret about all the ways we’ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we’re living in a fallen state today and there’s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there’s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It’s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” You can’t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.","But the thing about the master’s house, in this analogy, is that it’s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.","One of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet’s organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words “Welcome to Rivendell” were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from “Lord of the Rings.” “We call this house Rivendell,” Benet said sheepishly. “It’s not a very good Rivendell. It doesn’t have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.”","Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet’s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.","Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as “the ‘summer’ of peer-to-peer” — its salad days. “But then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,” he said. “And partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.” A graduate of Stanford’s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he’s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. “The rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,” he said. “The structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.” He continued: “It was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it’s now your turn to protect it.”","Protocol Labs is Benet’s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet’s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol — HTTP — pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call “historic versioning,” so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) “Right now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,” Benet said. “So you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.” But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet’s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.","Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn’t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company’s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.","And yet — as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out — there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. “Let’s say you’re trying to build an open Twitter,” Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. “I’m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.” A closed architecture like Facebook’s or Twitter’s puts all the information about its users — their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network — into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.",,Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.,Invalid email address. Please re-enter.,You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.,View all New York Times newsletters.,"Running Facebook’s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook’s point of view, they’re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service — and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world — is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people — much less two billion — was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.",Advertisement,"So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem — the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards — turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can’t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we’re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers’ markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.","The first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres — one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook.","The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.","History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a “peer-to-peer electronic-cash system” in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.","First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database — the blockchain — scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.","Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer’s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right — and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists — you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called “mining.”","For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being “in charge” of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn’t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.","These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.",Advertisement,"These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet’s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a “presale” of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.","The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor — in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network’s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.","Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of “tokens,” not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn’t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. “I like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it’s like an arcade,” he says. “You go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we’re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It’s not meant to be a real currency; it’s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.” Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon’s argument. “To me, what’s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,” he says. “They don’t have to resemble money.”","Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. “I hate it,” Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s “are scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.” Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s — and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether — is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.","Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson’s partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. “Uber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,” Burnham says. “Yes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map — and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.” But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there’s a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. “At some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,” Burnham says.","The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there’s a case to be made for adding another “basic layer” to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users’ past trips, credit cards, favorite locations — all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn’t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you’d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.","How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.","As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.",Advertisement,"“You think about the ’90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,” Dixon says. “You’re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.”","Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. “How can we fix the internet if we can’t even make coffee?” she said with a laugh.","Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone’s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta’s, “headquarters” seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers’ collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum’s smart contracts into their own systems.","The true test of the blockchain will revolve — like so many of the online crises of the past few years — around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don’t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn’t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can’t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).","The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity — which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history — and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of “self-sovereign” identity — as the parlance has it — was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.","What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu’s Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn’t present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I’d be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether.","Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. “There may be many corporate entities that I don’t want seeing that data, but maybe I’d like to donate that data to a medical study,” she says. “I could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.”","The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook’s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. “If someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,” Dixon says, “that could be pretty compelling.”",Advertisement,"Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. “Look at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,” Dixon says. “That means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a ‘bug bounty’ is? Someone says, ‘If you hack my system, I’ll give you a million dollars.’ So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one’s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.”","Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity — your social connections, your purchasing history — could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users — what security experts call “honey pots” — is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sniﬃng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, “It’s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.”","So much of the blockchain’s architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line.","Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (“self-sovereign”) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.","The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have “a right to a private data store,” where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn’t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.","Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical — almost communitarian — possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don’t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.","Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can’t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.","Steven Johnson is the author of 10 books, most recently “Wonderland.” He last wrote for the magazine about the science of communicating with extraterrestrials.",Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.,"A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2018, on Page MM36 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble.

So why shouldn't we change how we shape our buildings to get ready for them?",Early adopters will probably buy personal flying vehicles in the not too distant future.

His ideas are most certainly out there, but it's Bombardier's sort of creative thinking that keeps us moving forward.","That's the basis for my Drone Tower, which would look like a futuristic condo building, with large balconies built to accommodate small electric aircraft or shipping drones.

The IOTA Foundation has announced that it has teamed up with Taipei City to help it reach its smart city goals.,"The capital of Taiwan is to integrate IOTA’s blockless distributed ledger technology, Tangle, to explore the possibilities of meeting its ‘Smart City Living Lab’ needs through a variety of projects.","The first project will be digital citizen cards with built-in TangleID, preventing them from being tampered with. It’s hoped that this will provide citizens with peace of mind without worrying about identity theft or fraud whether through voting, providing background medical record information, or by using any government-related service. Other areas that are being explored include inter-organisation and inter-city data exchanges, and healthcare.","“With Taipei City always thinking ahead and with IOTA’s technology, this partnership is a strategic move to usher in the era of smart cities to the citizens of Taipei,” said Wei-bin Lee, Commissioner of the Department of Information Technology in the Taipei City Government, in a press release.","A project that is currently underway is Airbox. As a joint effort by Edimax, Realtek, Asus, and Academia Sinica, LASS and Taipei City, they are creating palm-sized air sensors that detect temperature, humidity, light, and pollution. These sensors, installed in citizens homes and 150 Taipei City elementary schools, will collect and share air quality data online, making it one of the most detailed environmental sensor networks in the world.","Last November, it was reported that more than 20 firms had joined the IOTA Foundation’s data marketplace, a new open initiative seeking to create a platform for firms to buy and sell data from sensors and IoT-connected devices. Some of the companies include Microsoft, Bosch, Tine, PwC, Accenture, and Fujitsu.","Now, working with BiiLabs, a startup focused on distributed ledger technology, the data from Airbox will be placed on the Tangle to receive payment in IOTA. Real-time air pollution monitoring will be ensured via IOTA’s technology, which will be used by all the PM2.5 stations in the country.","Lman Chu, Co-Founder of BiiLabs, added that the collaboration between IOTA, BiiLabs, and Taipei City offers exciting possibilities for sustainability, adding:","“There is enormous potential for other opportunities with IOTA’s DLT for the Internet of Things, as well as Smart Cities.”","The IOTA is the first distributed ledger to go beyond the blockchain, enabling it to overcome fees and scaling issues, permitting machines to transact data and money with each other.

First time poster here and really need some advice. My boyfriend and I have been dating about 5 years now. I'm turning 30 in two months and he's just hit 40.,"Long story short, he wants kids, he wants them now (or really soon) because he's getting old, and the longer I wait to have kids the more potentially problematic the pregnancy might be.","I don't want kids and I personally don't feel ready for them. We're both financially in a really good place, and definitly have the social and financial capability of raising children but I'm not ready to give up my life for my child. I'm one of those people who wants to stay at home and raise my children and teach them myself and not pass them to parents / daycare / live-in help. That would mean ending my career and dreams or at least postponing them a good few years until the child has grown up enough.","I'm kinda scared that this means the end of our relationship. He doesnt want to wait too long and I don't know, if ever, when I'll be ready for children.","Any advice / viewpoints or suggestions will be appreciated. Also parents, how did you know when you wanted kids?",Edit: wow! I am overwhelmed by the amount of feedback and advice. Many points made are totally valid and i really do need to examine what I want.,"Before you speak to him further about it or do anything else, you have to give some serious thought to what exactly you think and want (100% independently of him). Try and get clear in your own head, do you not want kids at all, or are you just not ready for them now? You say you don't know when if ever you will be ready for children, but then you also say you're just ""not ready"" and talk about how you would want to raise your hypothetical future children. I know it's hard to be sure either way about what you'll want in the future, all you really know is you don't want/are not ready for kids NOW. But I think it would really help for you to examine your own feelings or wants as much as possible because not being ready for kids now but wanting to have them later is a matter of timing and that's something you can potentially find a workable compromise on - 40 is not ""old"" and at almost 30, you still have at least 5 years time before you're likely to face major problems conceiving (YMMV obviously), however if you don't want kids at all ever, or are pretty sure that you won't, there's not really a lot of compromise there if he desperately does. And if that's the case, you need to end it, and trust me, you'll be glad you did. The alternative is having kids when you know you don't want them and aren't cut out for it. Kids are probably the most major life decision you can make in terms of the impact on you life and lifestyle, and you can't undo them or take them back. Kids are not something you have as a compromise or to accede to your partner's desires.","Am guy. I agree with all the points made here, but what I would stress to OP is don't take too long to speak to him about it. I was in a similar situation in my early 30s and my fiance was in her mid 20s. I made mention on maybe 2 occasions that if we were to have children, I felt it was important to have them sooner rather than later. I didn't want to be 70 with my eldest child turning 30. She didn't discuss her feelings on the matter. I think she was afraid that not accepting my view would be a deal breaker, but not discussing with me  what she wanted for the future meant that eventually we were on entirely different paths. There was no good reason that we couldn't have been on the same one. TALK TO HIM.","Oh I absolutely agree with you. When I said take some time out to get things clear in your own head before you discuss this any more with him, I had in mind a few weeks, like a month tops (after all, this is not a totally new topic, surely it's something you've considered before) not ""string this out for months or even years while you both slowly become unsatisfied, resentful and miserable and then break up anyway"".",You're right. I think i do need to examine what i really want and figure it out from there.,"As hard as it may be for you to read, I think this may really be a ""deal breaker"" issue for you.  If you really do not want children and he is actively pressuring you to have them, it's time to end it.  This is one of those issues there is no ""compromise"" on.","Parenting isn't for everyone, and no one should be pressured into having kids they don't really want.  If you decide you never want children, that's okay too.  :-)","You should never have kids for someone else. You say you don't want kids and don't feel ready for them. But honestly it sounds like you straight up don't want kids, and the ""don't feel ready"" argument is just an excuse so that not wanting kids isn't the only reason why you won't have them. But it's okay to just say, ""I don't want kids because I just don't.""","You should cross post to /r/childfree. Many posters have gone/are going through the ""SO wants kids, I don't"" problem. They can help you work through a talk with your SO. Because that's what you need to do. You should also figure out if you would be willing to adopt (but only because you would want to, of course) and bring that up if you would. For some people pregnancy freaks them out or they're too old to go through pregnancy so adoption is always an option.","Totally agree.  There's nothing wrong with saying ""I don't want children.  Period.""  If OP's SO has a problem with that, then I don't see a future for this relationship.","While I agree with most of what you say I want it to be known that /r/childfree can be less than friendly. They have rather extreme ideals about being SOOOO childfree that they if anyone remotely mentions the possibility of children or like you just said adoption then you would be ridiculed, slandered, and banned. I absolutely do not want children and went there for likewise thoughts. They however took something I said as a ""bingo"" (some term they use) thought I was trying to convert them into accepting children and filled my inbox with hate mail. The fact that she asked ""Also parents, how did you know when you wanted kids?"" tells me that with this mentality and the fact that she wants her relationship to work means they will not be nice to her. They have very strong negative views when it comes to making a relationship work when one spouse wants a child and the other doesn't.","I frequent the /r/childfree sub to read posts and haven't seen much of the negativity you've described. They may have strong opinions but they're valid. I'm sorry you were personally attacked when you posted there. OP, if you don't want to post your own situation just search the sub and the wiki. There are a lot of resources there.",I actually missed the question for parents in your OP. You could always go to the /r/parenting sub and ask? Or a similar sub. I've never visited any so I can't tell you much about them. And then there's the /r/fencesitter sub. It's a smaller sub but may help.,"Reddit has a sub for everything! I'm actually pro adoption. He's totally not. To me I wantbto find someone to spend my life with. if kids come, so be it. If they dont, no sweat on my back.","It is. Children are the ultimate dealbreaker, so it's better if you rip the bandaid off and break up. It'll hurt but you'll find someone who doesn't want them either.","No, some people really don't want kids. Ever if possible. I have an amazing SO. I still don't want kids.","Eh, that's what my mom says and I find it quite wrong (though OP mentions something about not now, so maybe she's a fence sitter). You're either a fence sitter and finding that person pushes you off the fence into the ""want kids"" territory, or you really and truly don't want kids regardless of who you're with.",That's not someone who actually doesn't want kids. That's someone who doesn't want kids in their particular situation.,"I don't want kids. There is no-one I could possibly want to have kids with. I could meet someone and think ""our babies would be cute"", but I still don't want to bear or raise those hypothetical babies.","If you simply don't want kids, then no-one who wants kids is a good match, no matter how much you love them.Not wanting children is not a problem to be solved by love. It's a perfectly valid life choice, and it requires matching with others who have the same life plan.","Yes, someone can not want kids and then change their mind.",Someone can want kids and then change their mind.,"But if you don't want kids and then suddenly meet someone and suddenly want kids after all, that was a mistaken situational factor, not an actual change from one end to the other.","This feels like getting lost in the weeds of semantics. I hope the direction that we are going in is simply to believe people and respect their feelings. You said you don't want kids -- I believe you, full stop.",The point I wanted to emphasize is that people who don't want kids are not just missing the perfect partner who will make them suddenly realize they're wrong and they actually want kids.,"Sometimes people change their minds. About all kinds of things. Including kids. But for someone who actually doesn't want them, it's not just about missing the right co-parent.  Any more than someone who wants kids is just missing the right partner to live a childfree life with.","Sometimes, love is just not enough when there's a basic physical incompatibility.","As someone who desperately wanted children, whose partner refused to have them with her, I can tell you that even if you don't have them...well, at least in my case...I think about the children I didn't have every. single. day. I resent my parnter for denying me children every. single. day.","Yes, I chose to stay with him when I wanted children and he would not. That is on me. I thought I would get over it. I never have, and I don't see myself ever getting over it. Yes, I have had therapy. Multiple therapists. Much therapy. Bottom line is, I had a life goal, I thought I could get past it, and I never did.","So even if your relationship doesn't end now, it might 5 years from now, 10 years from now, or you could stay together, and he could deeply resent you for not having children. It could affect and poison your relationship, even if you both end up child free.","For what its worth, in my 20's, I was firmly in the ""Nope, no kids camp"". At about 29, I changed to ""Hrm, maybe in a few years..."" and at about 32, it was like someone flipped a light switch, and all I could think of was ""babybabybabybaby!!!""","So, eventually, you may have a change of heart. But you may not. And there is a chance you are taking that your partner feels that having kids sooner than later is more important to him than staying with you, and end the relationship himself.","I am not, by any means, encouraging you to have a child you aren't ready for, and may never be ready for. Just giving you the perspective of someone that has been there, done that, has the t-shirt. Best wishes and good luck.",Yes.,"If you don't want kids, you don't want kids. That's an entirely acceptable plan, and you have every right to it.","If he wants kids, then he wants kids. That's an entirely acceptable plan, and he has every right to it.","But your life dreams are incompatible. It's unfortunate that you didn't run into this sooner, but if you have run into this now, it is how it is. Someone who doesn't want kids shouldn't have them.","If you would be up for kids and the timing is just wrong, you could explore other options. But you need to decide if you're actually just not feeling ready but will want them, or if they are just not a priority and not something you'll ever want more than what else you could have without them.  And if you decide you don't want them, you need to not have kids with someone else who wants to not have kids, and you need to let your boyfriend find someone with whom he too can live the life he wants.",Kinda sounds like it.  You two want very different things in the short term.  Unless you can resolve this by one of you giving up what you want ... you can't both get what you want together.,"If you can't agree on whether or not to reproduce, it's over.",Some thoughts,you don't have to have kids if you don't want them,waiting and waiting isn't going to work. Some women can have children quite late in life but you don't know if you're one of them.,So choose.  Do it now or make an active choice that you're not going to have kids and let the guy go.,because 3) it is very very unfair to hang onto someone who wants kids if you know in your heart you don't.,Now there are a couple of things you can do; get tested and see where your hormone levels are as far as getting pregnant and discuss your options with your boyfriend.  Maybe he wants to be the stay at home parent not you. Maybe there is a way one or the other of you can telecommute or both of you can alternate.,"But I really suspect this ""I'm not ready to give up my life for my child""  and ""I don't want kids"" are the truth and the rest is window dressing.","Absolutely--you need to find a common ground on this. If you are interested, here's my tale:",When I got married I had a few ground rules. No kids was one of them. My 9-years older husband agreed. Fast forward seven years and he's wondering when I'll grow out of my desire not to have kids.,"Cue the divorce. When people want kids they REALLY want them and vice versa when they don't. The lifestyles of ""kids"" vs ""no kids"" are vastly different.","Long story short, if you have kids to appease your partner, you are going to be unhappy as hell and you are going to fuck your life up. Don't fuck your life up.","Come chill with my homies at /r/childfree, we talk about this sort of thing all the time.","It probably does mean the end of the relationship, because if either of you were to ""compromise"" on this, you run a very real chance of feeling extremely resentful down the line because of it - you, if you wind up saddled with kids and it disrupts your career, and him, if he winds up childless when he really wanted to be a dad.","/r/childfree is also a fantastic subreddit for this question. There a quite a few people there that are ""fencesitters"" just like yourself","It depends how set in your decisions you are. What if you want kids but cannot? Will your SO stay with you? Accidents happen, would you run and get aborted?  Will you get his support so that you can also do what is important to you, or is it expected that you will be the only one sacrificing your life for something he wanted? Can he imagine staying home while you work? Does he value your relationship enough to make changes so that you are happy too?","If you are financially comfortable, there are other options than spending all of your time with your child and not work at all. I stayed home but ended up being exhausted and not spending quality time with my kids because I was doing all the chores.

Most of the chores, except for cooking, are done by a cleaning lady or by my husband. I shop online and probably pay more than I should but I save on time.","Without kids, I would probably have a better paying job but in no way do I feel I ended my career. And I do not regret having kids at all.",Not necessarily. It depends how much he wants them.,"I (28F) don't want kids and my partner (34M) does. When we started dating 8 years ago we had a vague plan to split up so that he could find someone to have them with one day. The more time goes on, the more he realizes that his career wouldn't really allow him to do much parenting anyway, and he hates the idea of breaking up, so we'll probably stay together. If we stay together, there is zero chance that we'll have kids because I'd rather be dead, which he's known since we started dating.",You need to be straight with him - tell him that you're not going to have children and get yourself on some permanent/long-term BC. It's up to him to decide whether he wants you or kids more.,"I don't understand how you can maintain a long-term relationship in a constant state of limbo like that, isn't it exhausting? After 8 years, don't you want to feel really quite certain that both of you are committed and in this for the long haul not ""we had a vague plan to break up but now we'll probably stay together""? You're a stronger chick than me, that's for sure, I'd a wreck if I were in your shoes.",isn't it exhausting?,"Not really. I guess other circumstances in our lives haven't been very settled either - my boyfriend has only just got a permanent job after years on short-term contracts that involved moving around a lot. During our relationship, I've gone from undergrad to post-grad to working freelance, so it's not like I've had all my ducks in a row either. I guess at this point I'm getting around to starting to think about ""settling down,"" e.g. buying a home rather than renting and making a plan to actually stay in our current city, rather than expecting to move on, but until now everything has been temporary anyway.","If we break up I'd be sad about the loss of this relationship, but the idea of being single in middle/old age doesn't bother me.","Fair enough, as long as the current situation is working for both of you that's cool. There's no rule that people have to be totally committed to each other after X amount of time together. And hey, even if people do think they are totally solid and committed, shit happens anyway and people break up, or divorce, or one person dies etc. Nothing in life is ever certain, I just feel like the extra uncertainty in your scenario is not something I could deal with myself.","even if people do think they are totally solid and committed, shit happens anyway and people break up, or divorce, or one person dies etc",Exactly. I think that acknowledging the possibility of breakup is sensible and realistic.,"""I don't want kids and I personally don't feel ready for them."" -- vainadaite","It's perfectly okay to just say ""I don't want kids"" without adding the second part.  Although I would have made it a priority to mention that before even thinking of moving in with a partner.  To me, it doesn't make sense to move in without making sure you're both on the same page when it comes to the ""kids or no kids"" issue.  But you really have to decide that now, and don't allow your SO to pressure you into doing something you may really not want to do.","Having kids only because a spouse or SO wants them is a really bad idea, in my opinion anyway.  MAYBE you'll ""fall in love with the child"" after it is born; then again, maybe you won't.  And those who claim ""it's different when it's your own"" leave out one important fact; when it's your own, you have the baby/child 24/7/365, and all the unpleasantness that can and does come with the parenting job.  As a parent of an only child by choice (and yes, it was a wanted pregnancy), I did all of that, and am very happy now that my son is grown and doesn't want any kids.  I'm not interested in dealing with any more babies.","I've read many unhappy stories from women who had children for either spouse or SO, or in-laws or whatever, and now they are miserable and wish they had their old life back.  You know, the life they had without children.  Don't let yourself become one of them.",Is it not an option for him to look after the children?,"I can appreciate the benefits of being greatly involved in your children's upbringing, but he may be just as capable as you in the primary carer role.","Additionally, if you do not want to give up your career, maybe he is more than happy to do so.  If finances are not so important, then this idea seems more plausible.","I think you should talk with him about your concerns, and discuss options on a solution.  As I see it, there are plenty of successful examples of fathers doing the primary parenting duties.","She didn't say that she'd have to do it, but that it is what she would want if she were to have kids.",That could be an option!,"Hate to pull out captain hindsight, but this would be why you'd want to make things like this sooner rather than later. Five years and only now it comes up?",But yeah sounds like a dealbreaker. Not fair to either of you to stay.,SO is divorced. And when we dated he was still in his im just gonna screw around phase. Then it got serious and the I want kids recently became an issue.,Yeah but I'm taking around the two year mark maybe 3. Must have gotten serious by then no?,It really only got serious about 8 months ago and we've started living together. This is when the baby thing started. I was (and am) on BC pills but never had the baby talk until recently.,Well in that case it's not as hard to see you going separate ways since you've only been living together less than a year.,"I'd been a little uncertain about kids when I was in my 20's, eventually concluding that I definitely didn't want to be a single mother, and I'd reconsider if/when I found someone I actually wanted to raise kids with.  As I got closer to 30, and started a serious relationship with someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, kids started seeming more appealing. At 32 I'm now married (to a wonderful man) and I'm pregnant with our first child.  If we want to have 2, without any major intervention or too much risk of health issues, it was time to get started.","If he really wants kids, and you don't want kids in daycare, couldn't he stay home with them for the first few years?  Since my husband works as a consultant, and I've got the 40 hour a week job which pulls in most of our income and provides our health insurance, our plan is for him to do most of the daytime childcare, I'll handle evenings & weekends when he has work, and we'll use the three sets of grandparents in town for babysitting when we need to.","With me and my SO (we've been together 8 months now) we have talked about our expectations (I'm 12 years older than him) and we have decided that IF we have children, he will stay home with them. I'm 36 and not sure we want to try something natural with the amount of issues that can come up. But the general consensus is since he wants kids and I'm kind of ambivalent toward the idea, he can take care of them.","""Also parents, how did you know when you wanted kids?"" - I always wanted to have a good family with kids and I was married thrice but only my last marriage when I met a girl whom I loved like crazy made me happy and just then I felt exactly ready for kids - to love them, to work for them, to raise them in love and happiness. But I've got a boy of my second marriage too and it occurred I didn't love my second wife so somehow I couldn't love my son either; finally we divorced and now I help them and meet my son regularly but yet there is no much love for him in my heart anyway especially in comparison to my younger daughter of my last beloved marriage.",12.0m,Subscribers,2.5k,Online,"Welcome to TwoXChromosomes, a subreddit for both serious and silly content, and intended for women's perspectives.

It cites an NSA spreadsheet leaked by Edward Snowden that shows nearly 7,500 email addresses monitored between 2002 and 2008, including addresses that appear to belong to foreigners the government suspects of ties to al-Qaeda, along with Americans accused of terrorist activity. But it also lists the email addresses of a former Republican operative and one-time political candidate, a professor at Rutgers University, and the head of the largest Muslim civil rights group in the country. We speak with Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Glenn Greenwald, who broke the story for The Intercept based on documents leaked by Snowden. “The only thing they really had in common is that they are all politically active American Muslims,” Greenwald says. “And that seems to be enough in the intelligence community to render these people suspicious.” We are also joined by two people Greenwald names in the article: Asim Ghafoor, a prominent civil rights attorney who has represented clients in terrorism-related cases; and Faisal Gill, an attorney and former senior policy director with the Department of Homeland Security. When asked what needs to be done in response to the revelations, Gill argues Congress should step in and exercise its authority over how the FISA courts approve surveillance. “In our cases, I don’t think there is probable cause … so the entire system needs to be examined,” Gill says. “What happens is you paint somebody with a broad brush, and they’re tainted for life. … Nobody wants a lawyer that the government suspects of being involved in these type of activities.”","AMY GOODMAN: “Shock” by Chilean hip-hop artist Ana Tijoux.

I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, a new report by the news website The Intercept has identified five prominent Muslim Americans who were spied on by the National Security Agency. An NSA spreadsheet leaked by Edward Snowden shows nearly 7,500 email addresses monitored between 2002 and 2008. Included in the spreadsheet are addresses that appear to belong to foreigners the government suspects of ties to al-Qaeda, along with Americans accused of terrorist activity, including Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan, who were both killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011.",But the list also includes the email addresses of a former Republican operative and one-time political candidate; a professor at Rutgers University; and the head of the largest Muslim civil rights group in the country. What these figures all have in common is that they are Muslim Americans. They appear to have been targeted for their Muslim identities and ties to various Muslim causes or individual cases involving Muslims.,"AMY GOODMAN: In total, The Intercept identified five leading Muslim-American activists, attorneys, academics whose email addresses were targeted for monitoring. None have ever been charged with a crime. In a video for The Intercept, Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, the country’s largest Muslim civil rights group, responded to the spying on him.","NIHAD AWAD: I was not aware that I was under surveillance, except recently. And I’m outraged that as an American citizen, my government, after decades of civil rights struggle, still the government spies on political activists and civil rights activists and leaders. It is outrageous, and I’m really angry that despite all the work that we have been doing in our communities to serve the nation, to serve our communities, we are treated with suspicion.","Our doors have been open for over 20 years. The government, obviously, from the scrutiny level that we have seen so far, they know everything. And they know perfectly well that we are a transparent, above-the-board American true success story. And they should celebrate our achievements as a civil rights organization that’s willing to stand up when many people are silent and not willing.","I believe that despite the pain and suffering I’m going through when I feel I’m being surveilled in my communications, wherever I go—here, abroad—all the dealings I deal with is being scrutinized by the government. I don’t feel free. I don’t feel the freedom that other people enjoy in this country. I have been—I feel that I’m being targeted because of my religious identity and my First Amendment activities, that are protected under the Constitution, and solely because I am vocal and I have been doing what every civil rights leader had to do for their communities and for their country. I do not compare myself to Martin Luther King, but he was surveilled. He was spied on. President Obama himself recognized this, and he—I paraphrase—he said, had it not been to the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, he would not be where he is now, the president. And yet, the government spied on Martin Luther King. I’m not like Martin Luther King. We are honored to continue the legacy of defending the civil rights of people. And I believe the government has not changed. When it comes to civil rights organizations, activists and leaders, I’m not surprised that, unfortunately, we have a long way to go.","If we do not speak up against the abuses of the NSA surveillance, if we do not stop the abuse of targeting people because of their religious identity and their First Amendment activities, if we do not stop this, if we do not speak against it, if we do not ask questions, it’s just a matter of time to come to you, as it has come to us.","It is true, and no one can deny, that American Muslims have been viewed with suspicion and have been treated as suspect. Some American Muslims have been put on the no-fly list for no obvious reason. And we stood for these people. Some people are being questioned about their faith—how many times do they pray, which imam do they follow, if they get up to the morning prayer, which mosque they frequent, how often do they read the Qur’an. These questions are asked sometimes to American Muslims at the borders. And we protest these policies. And apparently we are paying the price for speaking up against these, what I believe are, unconstitutional and un-American policies.","AMY GOODMAN: Nihad Awad is the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, the U.S.’s largest Muslim civil rights organization. He has been a guest on Democracy Now!","For more, we are joined by Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who broke the story. His newest story for The Intercept at First Look Media is “Meet the Muslim-American Leaders the FBI and NSA Have Been Spying On.” His new book is No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State. In a minute, we’ll speak with two of the Muslim Americans featured in his story.","Glenn, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about how you discovered this and the significance of spying on Muslim-American leaders.",GLENN GREENWALD: There were several documents in the Snowden archive [inaudible]—,"AMY GOODMAN: Glenn, we’re going to have to interrupt. We can hardly hear you, so we’re going to try to clean up that line. And we’re going to go to our guests right now in Washington as we do that: Faisal Gill, an attorney and former senior policy director with the Department of Homeland Security, and Asim Ghafoor, the civil rights attorney who has represented clients in terrorism-related cases, previously sued the government for warrantless wiretapping—among the five prominent Muslim Americans who had their email addresses monitored by the NSA.","Faisal Gill, let’s turn to you first. You ran for the House to be a representative in the Legislature in Virginia. You’re a Republican lawyer. You worked for the Department of Homeland Security, had some of the highest clearance. Can you explain when you found out or even suspected you were being targeted by the NSA?","FAISAL GILL: I did not find out that I was suspected by the NSA until I spoke to Glenn. Glenn called me. I went to New York, I met with Glenn, and that’s the first time that I found out that I was targeted by the NSA. Before that, it wasn’t even a thought in my mind that I could be suspected of any sort of wrongdoing or would be surveilled or would be monitored at all.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, well, of course, the government has often said that this surveillance is limited and that if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about. What’s your response to that?","FAISAL GILL: Well, if that’s the criteria that we’re going to use, then we just need to throw out the entire Fourth Amendment. Our entire justice system is premised on the fact that not whether somebody has anything to hide or not, but whether law enforcement has a probable cause. I mean, under regular criminal law, what you have is, if the police go in without a warrant or without an effective warrant, they go in and they even find evidence of crimes, those evidence are thrown out, even if they find evidence of a crime, because under our Constitution, the right to privacy exists. Under our Constitution, the question, again, is not whether you have something to hide or not, but whether law enforcement has a reasonable expectation or reasonable suspicion to believe that you’ve committed a crime. So I think that saying that is just ridiculous.","AMY GOODMAN: Faisal Gill, talk about your work experience. I mean, this monitoring started under the Bush administration. You were working for George W. Bush.","FAISAL GILL: Yeah, I mean, I was working for President Bush, worked in the Department of Homeland Security. I was not involved in monitoring, so I, you know, was never involved in any sort of FISA warrants or anything of that sort, so I would not know that. I understand—after 9/11, I understand that there is a need for surveillance, and the program needs to expand. And I also understand that there will be times where you might have a reasonable suspicion for someone that you might have to—that you suspect maybe committed a crime or maybe is involved in terrorist activities, that after you monitor them, you find out that, OK, no, they’re not involved in any of those activities. But there still has to be some start. There still has to be some suspicion. There still has to be some activity that would lead someone to believe that, OK, this person is involved. There is nothing in my background that would lead anybody to believe that. I’ve never had any connection with any terrorist groups, never been involved. I’ve passed polygraphs stating such. So, that’s what’s more troubling to me is that there is no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to suspect me of any of these activities.","AMY GOODMAN: We have Glenn Greenwald back with us, on the line with us from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. So, Glenn, start again by talking about how you found out this information.","GLENN GREENWALD: There were many documents in the Snowden archive which pertain to NSA and FBI targeting of Americans on U.S. soil, one of the most interesting of which was this spreadsheet called ”FISA recap” from 2008 that listed roughly 7,000 emails, at least several hundred of which were American citizens. And so we began the very arduous task of trying to determine the identity of the people who were using those email addresses. In most of the cases, it was actually quite difficult, if not impossible. But in some of the cases, we were able to find who the people were who were using these email addresses.","And we had maybe 20 or so Americans that we thought we should report on, and we narrowed it down to five, based on a variety of factors, including who was willing to be identified publicly as a surveillance target. A lot of people were very afraid of the stigma that it would have for them on their careers or their reputation forever and didn’t want to be named. And so, that was one big factor. And another one was making sure that we were reporting on people who clearly led very law-abiding, exemplary lives, as the five people here did.","And once we were able to determine their identities, and they were willing to go on the record, we began the process of reporting about how they were spied on and what possible rationale the government might have had. And what we found was that the only thing they really had in common is that they’re all politically active American Muslims who, in some form or another, have expressed criticism of the U.S. government or just been politically active in their communities and in the nation. And that seems to be sufficient within the intelligence community to render these people suspicious.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Glenn, since the file was labeled ”FISA recap,” was there any indication that these were actually all surveillance done pursuant to FISA warrants?","GLENN GREENWALD: The NSA and the FBI use the word ”FISA” in a very broad way, pretty much to mean any kind of authority they have to surveil. It doesn’t mean at all getting a specific warrant from the FISA court. During the three months that we were doing the reporting, the NSA was urging us not to publish any of their targets and were telling us that the reason—one reason was because they do everything under the aegis of the FISA court. So we had assumed, based on what the NSA said, that all of this surveillance was done pursuant to individual FISA warrants. But as we were about to publish last week, literally hours before we were going to publish, Justice Department sources began telling other media outlets that in fact they didn’t have FISA warrants for at least one of the people we were naming—Nihad Awad, the executive director of CAIR—and possibly others, that they may have surveilled them pursuant to other theories that allowed them to surveil Americans without individual FISA warrants. So we don’t actually know if they got specific FISA warrants or general FISA warrants for all or any of these individuals. That’s something that I think the Obama administration ought to answer.","AMY GOODMAN: The NSA and FBI both declined our request to join us on today’s program, but the NSA sent a joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice, which reads, quote: “It is entirely false that U.S. intelligence agencies conduct electronic surveillance of political, religious or activist figures solely because they disagree with public policies or criticize the government, or for exercising constitutional rights. … With limited exceptions (for example, in an emergency), our intelligence agencies must have a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to target any U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for electronic surveillance. These court orders are issued by an independent federal judge only if probable cause, based on specific facts, are established that the person is an agent of a foreign power, a terrorist, a spy, or someone who takes orders from a foreign power,” the government said. Your response, Glenn Greenwald?","GLENN GREENWALD: Well, first of all, I find it fascinating what they basically conceded there. They’re not denying that they take into account people’s political activism and their political views when deciding who should be surveilled. All they’re saying is, “We don’t base our decisions solely on those criteria.” But I think it’s very clear, based on that statement and the reporting that we did that’s in the article, that people’s political opinions and what they express and the nature and extent of their political activism is a significant factor in deciding who their surveillance targets are, which is incredibly disturbing. These are American citizens who, under the Constitution, are guaranteed the right to engage in this political expression and political activism, and it’s clearly being used as a grounds for surveillance.","The second issue I would add is that although we don’t know that they’ve been targeted pursuant to a FISA court warrant, because prior to the 2008 law the government could actually target Americans, for example, if they were on foreign soil, just by getting the attorney general to OK it—they didn’t need to go to the FISA court. Even if they got FISA court approval, everybody knows the FISA court is notoriously a rubber-stamping tribunal. They meet in complete secrecy. Only the government can attend. In the 30-year history of the FISA court, they have approved something like 35,000 government requests and rejected a grand total of 12 of those requests. We had a source who said, “You just show up at the FISA court judge’s house at 2:00 in the morning, and if he knows you and likes you, he’ll sign whatever warrant you put in front of him.” And so, I think everybody now knows that the fact that something was done with FISA court approval means absolutely nothing, given what a rubber-stamping and malleable tribunal that is.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Glenn, I want to ask you about the document you highlight in your report that instructs intelligence personnel how to format internal memos to justify FISA surveillance. In the place where the target’s real name would go, the memo offers the fake name “Mohammed Raghead” as a placeholder. The NSA issued a statement in response, saying it, quote, “has not and would not approve official training documents that include insulting or inflammatory language. Any use of racial or ethnic stereotypes, slurs or other similar language by employees is both unacceptable and inconsistent with NSA policy and core values.” Your response?","GLENN GREENWALD: This is a critical point. I think this is the critical context to understand the reporting. That document that we found, where they use this slur, “Mohammed Raghead,” as a sample for who they would get a FISA warrant against, is by no means the only evidence of rampant bigotry and anti-Islamic prejudice within the intelligence community. There was an award-winning story by Wired magazine from Spencer Ackerman in 2011 that found that huge numbers of training materials in the FBI instructed the FBI to view even moderate, law-abiding Muslims as serious national security threats. And he said they apologized, and they were going to revamp the program.","You know, if you look at what these surveillance targets have in common, one of the things they have in common is that they became the obsessive focus of some of the furthest right-wing, neoconservative, anti-Muslim fringes, like people like Frank Gaffney and that crowd, Pam Geller. They became obsessed, for example, with Faisal Gill when he was running for office in Virginia. They have long been obsessed with CAIR. And what I think that you see from all of this evidence is that these radicals, these anti-Muslim radicals in the United States, have enough of a foothold within the intelligence community to be able to use these vast surveillance weapons, that we’ve spent the last year documenting, to further their warped and bigotry-driven political agenda.","And just to go back to that statement that you asked me about, Juan, from the DNI, I mean, it’s really reprehensible what they’re doing. On the one hand, they’re saying, “We won’t in any way comment on why these people were surveilled,” on the other hand, “Now we’re going to smear them with innuendo by saying we would only surveil people if they’re agents of a terrorist organization or a foreign power and have done something that constitutes espionage or terrorism.” So, they’re smearing them while at the same time preventing them from actually addressing what it is that they supposedly did that merited this surveillance. And I think the only evidence we have publicly, based on all of the evidence that you just asked me about, all these documents, the history of the FBI and the NSA, is that they regard American Muslims, American citizens who are Muslims, who exercise their political rights, as being inherently suspicious and worthy of surveillance. It is exactly the same kind of surveillance abuses from the ’60s and ’70s, when the activists who were considered threatening of that time, like civil rights leaders or antiwar activists or antigovernment advocates on the left and the right, were similarly regarded as threatening if they exercised their political rights, and were also subjected to surveillance.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’d like to bring in Asim Ghafoor on this issue, the civil rights attorney. You actually learned that you were being surveilled even before the Glenn Greenwald articles came out years ago. Could you talk about that?","ASIM GHAFOOR: Yes, sir. In 2004, a charity in Oregon that was under investigation by the U.S. Treasury Department—a group of lawyers were given a stack of documents, four pages of which I still cannot talk about today, because of warnings from the government that they would prosecute me if I did. But it has been publicly reported that those four pages were a summary of conversations of some overseas individuals with myself, my fellow lawyers and other staff here in the U.S., about a legal strategy on how to get delisted from Treasury designation. So, it wasn’t exactly terrorism. It was a group of people who were falsely accused of terrorism who were trying to hire a lawyer, use the civil justice system, suing the Treasury Department, suing the Office of Foreign Assets Control and other organizations in the U.S., government agencies in the U.S. That investigation ended up freezing the assets of the U.S. charity, jailing the leader for two years—and your show has covered that in the past—and freezing the assets of several individuals overseas. This was evidence of the government not only conducting warrantless surveillance, but then using that information to cause a very unjustified legal distress.","Ironically, in that case, we sued, we were found to have standing, and the case went on from 2006 until 2012, until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed it on a technicality, saying that under the Section 1810 that we did of the original FISA, which was amended, of course, in 2008, we did not—while we had standing, while we were able to prove we were surveilled without a warrant, the government had immunity on use of that information, so we could not collect damages. It was a technicality, which Congress has to fix. And unfortunately, that’s one thing which will hurt us in trying to pursue any legal remedies on this new set of wiretapping, although, as a lawyer, as my fellow counsel from Brazil and here next to me in the studio know, that there’s always an opportunity to find another way to bring a lawsuit. But—",AMY GOODMAN: Asim—,"ASIM GHAFOOR: Yes, ma’am?","AMY GOODMAN: —Ghafoor and Faisal Gill, as well as Glenn Greenwald, we’re going to break. When we come back, I mean, the significance of your case, among other things, Asim, is that you’re talking about, whatever the case was, you were being surveilled, monitored, your email was being read, as you represented clients. And I want to ask about this issue of client-attorney privilege, among many other things. We are talking to the Muslim-American leaders the FBI and NSA has been spying on. Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, exposed this in The Intercept. We’ll be back with them in a minute.",[break],"AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We’re joined now by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald. He’s just broken the story in The Intercept called “Meet the Muslim-American Leaders the FBI and NSA Have Been Spying On.” We’re also joined by two of the subjects of that piece. Faisal Gill worked in the George W. Bush administration from late 2001 until 2005. He served as an intelligence policy adviser in the Department of Homeland Security, where he was authorized to access sensitive, compartmented information, a classification level reserved for the nation’s most closely guarded secrets.","AMY GOODMAN: The NSA began monitoring Gill’s email account in 2006 after he left DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, and co-founded a law firm with our other guest, Asim Ghafoor, a prominent civil rights attorney who has represented clients in terrorism-related cases. He has also worked extensively on Capitol Hill as a legislative assistant and lobbyist. During the period that he was being monitored by the NSA, he was already suing the government after an accidental leak revealed warrantless eavesdropping on his phone calls with his clients. Ghafoor was awarded more than $20,000 in damages, but the judgment was later reversed.","Asim Ghafoor, your feelings when you learned what was taking place and this call that you got from The Intercept about these documents?","ASIM GHAFOOR: Again, it was unbelievable. In 2004, it was unbelievable, and in 2014, 10 years later, even more unbelievable. When the editor called me and told me, very cryptically, “We have an email address. Can you confirm your identity? Can you mail me an email from there?” I didn’t know who that was. Was he somebody also from the government? You know, I was worried for about 10 seconds before I googled it and realized this editor was the real thing. I emailed him, and then I met two of Mr. Greenwald’s colleagues, the two journalists who interviewed me. And it just became like Alice in Wonderland all over again.","This is something where, as a lawyer, as a civil rights lawyer who advises people who come to me for compliance issues when they’re somewhat in trouble with the government, when they’re in big trouble with the government, I really have to be careful about how I communicate with them. And I’m happy to maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy. Our legal ethics rules do tell us you have to be very discreet with what you say on a phone, email. But to think that the government was listening in on it was just really a shock to me. And I think it’s a disservice, really, to all lawyers, whether we’re a Muslim-American lawyer like me, who worked on Capitol Hill, who has many friends in the government, in the current White House, as well. I had some friends in the previous White House, even though I’m a lifelong Democrat. It was just really a shock.","And to think that a government lawyer or government agent, many of whom—most of whom who, you know, are very professional, wake up every day, do their job to secure America, to push the envelope and push the limit, to go to the supervisors, to go to a judge and say, “We need to listen to this guy,” again, it just makes no sense. And if it was because I was winning a case against them in 2005, and they decided, “You know what? We’re going to listen in on this guy,” again—I’ve said this before, I said this to the journalists at The Intercept, and I’ll say it again—if a lawyer were to go in court, come up with some evidence that they got from reading my emails to my clients or maybe to co-counsel, to a paralegal, to anyone that I deal with on a legal basis, on a day-to-day basis representing my clients in civil rights cases, a judge would laugh them out of court. So, what made a lawyer or an agent or somebody in the government think that they could even use this information? To me, that’s just as baffling as the fact that this whole regime has been implemented.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Glenn Greenwald, your report covers the period from 2002 to 2008. Is there any indication that the people targeted during that period, that that stopped after 2008 at all, or you just didn’t have further documentation of what happened after that?","GLENN GREENWALD: Right, the document that we have is from 2008. We have one from 2007, as well. It seems like the format of the document changed once the law changed in 2008. There’s zero reason to think that this stopped. I mean, some of the surveillance that’s talked about on this document indicates termination dates, and others of it say “sustained,” meaning it’s ongoing. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to believe or to claim, or anything like that, that any of this stopped in 2008. And as The Washington Post noted in the story they did a week ago, about 90 percent of the collections being about nontargets, they said—and they’re right—that the Obama administration dramatically expanded the amount of surveillance that takes place both internationally and domestically. So we don’t have the proof that it continued beyond that, but the documents do say “sustained” for some of the surveillance.","Let me just quickly add one thing about Asim Ghafoor’s case, which is, when the 2004 case was first—first surfaced, what we knew was that his calls to his clients had been monitored. I don’t think we knew that he was the target. It could have been that his clients were the target, and they listened in anyway, knowing that it was an attorney-client communication. In this case, it was not his clients’ email addresses, but his email addresses that were on the NSA and FBI’s list. And I think that has sort of escalated the nature of the revelation.","AMY GOODMAN: And, Glenn, you postponed the release of this piece for over a week. Why?","GLENN GREENWALD: We had been, as I said earlier, led to believe for several months by the NSA that all of this spying was done pursuant to FISA warrants. And so, when we wrote our story, although we didn’t say that they had FISA warrants, because we didn’t know that, we wrote the story on the premise that it was done under the aegis of the FISA court, because that’s what we were led to believe. Literally hours before we were going to hit the publish button, one of the media partners with whom we were working talked to fairly high-level sources at the Justice Department and the FBI, who told them that in fact they didn’t have an individual FISA warrant against Nihad Awad and maybe one or two of the other targets. And so, we didn’t want to publish something, the accuracy of which we were uncertain, and so we said, “Let’s hold the story and investigate this. I need to resolve it definitively or say in the story that now there’s uncertainty surrounding this issue.” And so we just took a week to make sure we had the story 100 percent right.","AMY GOODMAN: And what, ultimately, did you conclude?","GLENN GREENWALD: We went back to the NSA, and we said to them, “You know, for months you’ve been saying this has been under the aegis of the FISA court, and now you have Justice Department—anonymous people in the Justice Department supposedly saying that you don’t have it.” And they said, “Well, we can’t tell you what they said. We won’t comment specifically on any of these cases.” And based on all the information we were able to get, it seems likely that, at least prior to the 2008 law, they had other theories internally about how they could spy on Americans without FISA warrants. So we don’t actually know whether or not they actually did have FISA warrants against all of these individuals. And I really think the Obama administration needs to answer that question.","JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Faisal Gill, I’d like to ask you, given these revelations and given the constant reporting of the unbridled surveillance of our government on American citizens, what do you think needs to be done? And what would you hope that Congress would do at this stage?","FAISAL GILL: Well, I think Congress needs to step up and exercise oversight authority over the intelligence community. The biggest thing that came out of this is, if the Department of Justice and NSA statements are correct, then the FISA process and what constitutes probable cause needs to be seriously examined, because, again, in our cases, I don’t think there is probable cause, which means reasonable suspicion to believe that a crime has been committed. And that’s absolutely ridiculous to think that in this case there was probable cause, or in my case or Asim’s case or Nihad’s case there’s probable cause. So, the entire system needs to be examined.","And as Glenn mentioned, the FISA court is a rubber stamp. You cannot have that in cases like this, because what happens is you paint somebody with a broad brush, and they’re tainted for life, as I know from personal experience when it happened to me before, and now, as well. This is going to taint you. Nobody wants a lawyer that the government suspect is involved in these type of activities. And then what you get is you get a statement from the government that basically backs up the fact that they believed you were involved in those kind of activities, which is exactly what we got from the Justice Department and NSA.","So Congress really needs to examine the FISA court. They need to put in some safeguards in place. And they need to make sure that it is not a rubber stamp, because it does have real-life implications for the people that are targets. I mean, I’ve said this before. You go into any county in the United States and you look at the success rate for getting a search warrant for a crime such as breaking and entering or any other crime, even a petty crime, you’re not going to find a 99.9 percent success rate for those search warrants. Judges question you more on that. So if judges are questioning you more on that, I think the FISA court should be held to a little bit of a higher standard. And we want to make sure that anybody that we’re targeting and we’re surveilling without their knowledge, listening to their emails, they’re people that we really do suspect are involved and engaged in these type of activities, and the reason we believe that is because we have some credible evidence, and we just need to listen to them to basically either get more evidence that we can either use in court or to prosecute them or to stop them from whatever they’re trying to do.",AMY GOODMAN: Asim Ghafoor—,FAISAL GILL: So—,"AMY GOODMAN: I want to just interrupt, because we have a few seconds. In both your cases, are you planning to sue the government now for surveillance?","ASIM GHAFOOR: If I could answer that first, I have no plans to sue the government right now. I believe the remedy is with Congress, with oversight, and the administration doing the right thing with the budget. But I’ll keep my options open. We have a few years, once we’ve discovered this, before our statute of limitations runs out. So, it’s something I’ll definitely look into.",AMY GOODMAN: Faisal Gill?,FAISAL GILL: Not at this time. I would like Congress to step up and exercise oversight authority.,"AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you all very much for being with us, Faisal Gill, as well, attorney and former senior policy director at the Department of Homeland Security, allegedly targeted by the NSA. And thanks so much to Asim Ghafoor, prominent civil rights attorney. Glenn Greenwald, again, thanks for being with us, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. His latest story is at The Intercept. We’ll link to it: “Meet the Muslim-American Leaders the FBI and NSA Have Been Spying On.”"

  IOTA News -  ,A IOTA snapshot is a process where all the transaction history gets reset. After the snapshot processing resumes and a new Tangle grows on this basic ledger. Until it grows so big that another snapshot is required.,IOTA’s nodes are receiving transactions in a staggering amount. They need to keep track of them all and sort through them. This means ever increasing memory and CPU requirements. To combat this every now and then a snapshot occurs. This essentially throws away all the transaction history and resets the IOTA ledger to a list of all the addresses that have a nonzero balance and of course their balances.,After the snapshot processing resumes and a new Tangle grows on this basic ledger. Until it grows so big that another snapshot is required.,"In the future nodes will decide for themselves when to do a snapshot, but at the moment this is still a synchronized operation. The snapshot ledger is prepared by the IOTA team, then it is verified that it contains all the transaction history correctly by a number of nodes, and only when the consensus is that the snapshot data contains no errors the green light is given and every node out there will switch to this new ledger at the same time.","Well you definitely should. At least as long as your wallet takes its state information from the Tangle, like the light wallets are doing at the moment. The wallet stores absolutely no state information on your device. That means it has to use the seed you provide at login to generate addresses one by one, check if these addresses are used in a transaction already, and if they are it knows that it already gave out those addresses and can retrieve the balances of these addresses to give you your total wallet balance.","However, since the snapshot removes all transaction history from the Tangle, the wallet loses all its state information and therefore will show you a zero balance after the snapshot! Don’t worry. This is expected. All you need to do is reattach all previously used receive addresses to the tangle manually.","Wait, what?  Yep, because IOTA was designed for the Internet of Things, and those devices follow simple rules with extreme precision and patience, this is no problem for the IoT devices. They will happily and patiently reattach every address they ever used to the Tangle. Our problem is that we are no IoT devices. And the wallets at the moment don’t hide this tedious process behind the scenes. So we will have to do this manually so that we can see our balance being restored.","One additional important reason to do this is to avoid re-using any addresses that we have used before the snapshot, so we don’t end up with multi-spends from these addresse and won’t be subjected to hackers intercepting out transactions.","I know, WTF, right? But this is what happens when beta software gains large acceptance before the hurdles get ironed out. We can complain all we want about this but fact it we will have to deal with this until the next generation of wallets come out that do this stuff automatically behind the scenes.","There are a few things you can do in preparation of a snapshot. One is to log into your wallet using your seed, go to the history section, then click on addresses. You now want to make a note of the amount of addresses used, plus the what the first and last address are. That way, when you want to restore the wallet after the snapshot, you have some data that can assist you in knowing: 1. whether you are in the correct seed. (You can compare the first receive address you re-attach with the one you wrote down) 2. how many times you will have to re-attach receive addresses for your funds to show up.",Knowing this is having won half the battle. You know immediately if you are in the correct seed. And you know exactly how many re-attachments it will take to regain your balance. Fort the rest it is just a tedious process.,"First of all, don’t panic, your IOTAs are most likely perfectly safe.","Second, no matter who or what, *never* give your seed to anyone. Especially not if they say they are an IOTA developer who will help you recover your balance. These people are scammers and will steal your IOTA.",I will show the steps you can take to recover your balance. I will also try to explain to you why this happened. I recommend you take the time to read and understand the how and why. Understanding what you invested in is the best thing you can do to keep your investment safe.,"Contrary to what most people believe your IOTA wallet does *not* contain your IOTAs. Instead, your IOTAs are safely stored in one or more addresses in the Tangle. You can see your wallet as a browser that knows how to retrieve the balance of an address. To do that it contacts a so-called node, and asks it to find the balance of that address in the distributed ledger database that the Tangle actually is. To be able to retrieve your entire balance, the wallet will usually have to retrieve the balances of multiple addresses that belong to your wallet and add them all up. The end result is displayed as your current balance.","Now here is an important thing: the wallet does not know at first how many and which addresses exactly to retrieve to accumulate your balance. The only starting point it has is the 81-character seed you provided when you logged into the wallet. This seed is the key that enables the wallet to always re-generate the addresses used by your wallet deterministically. Deterministically means that given the same seed it will always be able to generate the exact same sequence of addresses one by one. To determine your total accumulated balance the wallet will ask the node for each address balance in succession until the node indicates that an address cannot be found because it is not present in a transaction in the Tangle. This indicates to the wallet that it has not generated/used that address before, so it can safely stop accumulating address balances. This fact is important to remember, because it will shortly explain why your balance is currently zero.","The wallet will generate new addresses as needed in two important ways. First, and most visible, when you want to receive IOTAs in your wallet you will need to generate a new receive address and attach that to the Tangle. Addresses are not supposed to be re-used because the signing process used to spend funds from an address uses one-time signatures. Because of the one-time nature of the signing process, the private key for that address gets partially exposed by every spend from the same address, opening it to a brute force attack. And since anyone that has the private key to an address can spend the funds in that address it’s not very wise to open yourself up to such an attack. That’s why the wallet tries to defend itself against such attacks by automatically moving the remaining funds after spending to a new address in the wallet. It will also give you a ‘private key reuse’ error whenever you try to spend from an address you have already spent from.","So the second way in which the wallet will generate new addresses is by moving the remainder of a spent address to a new address. When you instruct it to send a certain amount of IOTAs to another address, what it will do is go through the known addresses in your wallet one by one, starting from the first, by generating the addresses in sequence from the seed. The wallet accumulates the amount of IOTAs it finds along the way on addresses with a non-zero balance, until it has accumulated enough IOTAs to cover the amount you want to send. The contents of the non-zero addresses it has accumulated in this way will be sent as a single transfer to the receiving address and -if there is a remainder- the remainder will be sent as a second transfer to a newly generated address in your wallet. This will cause the latter address to be attached to the Tangle, so it lives there now, and the wallet will be able to see it as in use already whenever it scans for your balance as outlined above. All addresses used as the input for the transaction will end up having a zero balance, so they are not likely to be re-used any more, unless you make the mistake of not creating a new receive address but re-using a previous one.","It is important for the recovery process that you have an idea of how many addresses were in use before you ‘lost’ your balance (before the Snapshot happened, see below). For most people that will be up to one or two dozen addresses. But for people who used the wallet regularly before the snapshot happened that can easily go up in the hundreds. I personally have helped someone retrieve his balance who had 150+ addresses in use in his wallet.","To understand what happened you need to know what happens when the IOTA foundation generates a new Snapshot of the IOTA ledger database. This is done every now and then for maintenance reasons. The last Snapshot was created on Tuesday October 24th, 2017. One reason for taking a Snapshot is that the Tangle is constantly expanding, and therefore taking up more and more memory. To help nodes in keeping the amount of memory they need for storing the database limited, the Tangle is pruned by removing the history of transactions. Remember that after every transaction you end up with no longer used addresses with a zero balance. The transactions that caused these only take up space and are no longer necessary for correct functioning of the nodes. There are even more ways that can cause zero balance transactions to occur, like when a wallet generates and attaches a new address to the Tangle. There are also transactions that are used as messages between systems and do not contain any balance.","So after a Snapshot is taken the end result is a simple list of all addresses that contain a non-zero balance and their respective balances, and no history of how those balances happened is preserved on the regular nodes. By the way, this history *does* get preserved on so called perma-nodes, like ioatsear.ch, which will keep track of the entire history all the way back to the first transaction ever. But for most use cases this history is not necessary. It’s only the non-zero end balances that are important, since they are the only ones that can be spent.",Note that the Snapshot process is such that any transactions that were not confirmed yet while the Snapshot was being taken will be canceled and it will be as if the funds never left the wallet of the sender. So that means some transactions may have to be performed again once you have restored your wallet. A deposit from your wallet to Bitfinex that was canceled will have never left your wallet. A withdrawal from Bitfinex to your wallet that was canceled will have never left the Bitfinex wallet. Just send those transactions again when that happened. They should pose no problem.,"Now, remember how the wallet will figure out its balance? It will ask a node to retrieve the balances of each address it generates in succession from the seed, starting with the first one, that has been used in a transaction, until it finds a non-used address, which indicates that the wallet did not generate that address before. However, since the Snapshot has removed all historical transactions the first address it checks will not be found to be used by a transaction in the Tangle, and so the wallet stops scanning for balances immediately, because it thinks it has not generated that address yet, ultimately resulting in a zero accumulated balance.","So that’s the reason you see a zero balance. The wallet simply stopped scanning for addresses with balances too soon, because it does not know that the Snapshot process has removed the transaction history. This means that the remedy for finding your balance is simple. Start re-generating and attaching your previously used receive addresses one by one. This will cause zero-balance transactions using that address to be connected to the Tangle. Which means the wallet now can see the address is in use in the Tangle and ask the node for the corresponding balance. In particular, you need to do this as many times as you had used addresses in the past, so that they can all be found in the Tangle again. To be sure, this can be a tedious process and it would have been nice if the wallet designers had included a command that allows you to tell it to generate the next X addresses until it finds one with a balance. But that is not the case at the moment, so there is no use in complaining right now. I am sure this feature will show up in a next incarnation of the wallet.","The Sep 22nd and Oct 24th Snapshot processes have done two additional maintenance tasks that may result in you still not being able to successfully retrieve your correct balance. First, since the implementation of the Proof of Work function has changed from kerl to curl in August there was a need to transition balances to the use of the new curl implementation. A lot of people already did this transition as part of their upgrading their wallet from an older version. Since it turned out that there are people who managed to lose their seed and also many people who did not transition yet, the IOTA foundation has taken the precaution to remove those old-style kerl addresses from the Tangle and has taken custody of them. So if your previous wallet was from before version you may fall into that category. You will need to use the reclaim tool as explained further down to reclaim those funds.","Second, because it was found that quite a number of people had spent multiple times from the same address, thereby exposing their funds to being stolen, the IOTA foundation decided to take similar custody of those addresses so they are no longer vulnerable. That means if you accidentally spent from the same address more than once in the past, and this address was still holding a balance, you will need to use the reclaim tool as explained further down to reclaim those funds.",In both cases one or more of your address balances may still be ‘missing’ even after the wallet has re-generated the missing address in the Tangle. The balance of such addresses was moved to the IOTA foundation custody address. You can check for those addresses if you think that may be what has happened to them here: https://goo.gl/FGtXgp,"Allow for the page to load before searching through it, as it is a huge list.","You just copy an address you want to find out about to the clipboard, and then use control-F and paste to search on that page. Make sure you only use the first 81 characters of the address, as the 9 character checksum is not present in this list. I just paste the address and delete the last 9 characters.",If your address shows a category of KEY_REUSE or KEY_REUSE_OCT in this list then you have executed more than one spend from that address and the balance is now in custody of the IOTA foundation until you reclaim it.,If your address shows a category of CURL_UNUSED then your address was not transitioned to the new curl implementation yet and the balance is also in custody of the IOTA foundation until you reclaim it.,"For more details, see this announcement from the foundation: https://forum.iota.org/t/snapshot-public-validation-22-09-2017/4256","If you don’t remember the 3-character checksum or in any other way are unsure if you are using the correct seed, here are ways to find out:","If you know roughly how many addresses you used to have in your wallet, just go ahead and re-generate at least that amount of new receive addresses (detailed steps below). Along the way, usually towards the end, you should see your balance increasing. If your balance becomes non-zero that is a clue that you are definitely in your own wallet with the correct seed. If you cannot seem to get the entire balance you may either need to generate even more addresses, or some of your funds were taken into custody by the IOTA foundation for the reasons described above. In that case you will have to check the addresses which you think should contain a non-zero balance against the snapshot list. And if you find them there, you will have to reclaim them using the reclaim tool.","Making double sure that you are using the correct wallet can be easily done by using the iotasear.ch Tangle browser to check the history of an address. This means you can copy the first address and see if in the past funds were there. Assuming the first address was the first one to receive funds of course. If it did contain funds the amount is probably recognizable as your first IOTA withdrawal ever. Anyway, when any funds are there in the iotasear.ch history you can be sure you have used this seed before.","Finally,","If you are absolutely sure that the IOTA foundation took custody of some of your funds after checking the above, you will need to use the reclaim tool to reclaim your funds. Note that the reclaim process is a two-step process currently. NOTE: to make sure that you don’t make any typos when entering your old and new seeds with this tool i highly suggest you copy/paste them from a proven working copy. It would be silly to finally reclaim your funds to a seed that contains a typo and therefore the reclaimed funds would become irretrievable. UPDATE: The reclaim tool in phase 2 will ask once again for the new seed, so unless you make the same typo twice this seems not really to be a problem. In case multiple reclaims were put in, the one confirmed in the lowest milestone will be the one processed.",For more details on how to use the reclaim tool see this link for phase 1: https://blog.iota.org/gui-v2-5-2-latest-release-with-iota-reclaim-tool-32d364d6241a And this link for phase 2: https://blog.iota.org/gui-wallet-phase-two-of-the-reclaim-process-f5913109cf46, Prev Post,IOTA Price Technical Analysis: Price All Set To Surge,Next Post ,Emptied IOTA Wallets: Hackers Steal Millions Using Malicious Seed Generators,   Audi x IOTA Collaboration Successfully “Pushes New Use Case to Reality”  ,   NEXT Biometrics Teams with M2M IoT Specialist  ,   Creating the Architecture for a New Medicine  ,   A Distributed Search Engine for the Distributed Web  ,  Latest News ,  Audi x IOTA Collaboration Successfully “Pushes New Use Case to… ,  NEXT Biometrics Teams with M2M IoT Specialist ,  Creating the Architecture for a New Medicine ,   IOTA Foundation  ,  Introducing Untangled — the IOTA Podcast ,  Welcome Julia Schulz to the IOTA Foundation ,  Introducing the Omega Team ,Join our Telegram Channel,for IOTA News in realtime!,Do you want to join?,Download the Telegram  app  here
"Another Black man joins the police ‘execution list’ as cops will never cease taking Black lives. The victim, who is identified as Joseph Mann, is described as a peaceful young man, who has had no records of violence in the vicinity.","Joseph Mann, 50, used to work for the Department of Corrections until he had a mental breakdown in 2011 after the death of his mother. Since then, this mentally ill man has peacefully lived on the streets of Sacramento — until last month when he was shot 18 times and killed as he fled from police.",A wrongful death suit has been filed by the family of the deceased against the Sacramento police. But surprisingly the police have narrated a totally different story about the murder of Mann.,"Luckily a recorded phone video on that fateful day has refuted claims and narrations by the police that Joseph Mann was armed with a knife and a gun. That is a blatant lie as no gun was found at the scene of the incidence. Well, the video speaks for itself and tells how incredibly well the police Department can fabricate lies to cover up their irresponsibility and total negligence.","As to the evidence the video brings out, it is a dangerous path the police has taken. They now shoot their vulnerable innocent victims in the back. What is it, cowardice or lack of professionalism?","Honestly, the “back-shooting” position of the victim is a proof of a wrongdoing. A man, who is facedown or is running away, cannot be a deadly threat in any way possible. Just like Joseph Mann, many other Blacks have been killed in the same position proving the helplessness of the victim, yet the police will tell a completely different story.",,"Kindly SHARE this article on any social media of your choice to combat Police brutalities and racism.

" While tougher enforcement of immigration laws has been a significant factor in the reversal, most of the departing Mexicans are leaving on their own, a Pew Research Center report said Thursday. "," Citing Mexican census figures, the report found that 1 million Mexicans and their families (including U.S.-born children) left the U.S. for Mexico from 2009 to 2014. It said that U.S. census data for the same period shows an estimated 870,000 Mexicans entered the U.S. ", Pew's findings accounted for both documented and undocumented immigrants. ," Among the most common reasons Mexicans are saying adiós to the USA are a slow economic recovery here and the fact that they miss their families back home, the study found. "," In the past it was easier for immigrants to visit their families and return to the U.S. But with increased border enforcement, they remain in the U.S. until family ties pull them back home, said Ana Gonzalez the author of the report. ", , Related: How one Mexican company keeps its workers from crossing the border , Another factor that may be discouraging northern migration is tougher enforcement of immigration laws at the border and inside the U.S. ," ""U.S. border apprehensions of Mexicans have fallen sharply, to just 230,000 in fiscal year 2014 -- a level not seen since 1971,"" the report said. ", The number of Mexicans deported through heightened ICE enforcement has spiked. The Obama administration has deported more Mexicans than any other president. ," Despite the deportations, the majority of Mexicans who returned to Mexico between 2009 and 2014 have done it of their own volition. The Pew study found that only 14% of those who returned to Mexico in that time period did so because they'd been deported. "," While a majority of Mexicans living in Mexico still believe that life is better north of the border, a growing proportion is less impressed with the American Dream. "," ""Today, a third (33%) of adults in Mexico say those who move to the U.S. lead a life that is equivalent to that in Mexico,"" the report said. "," Mexicans have long represented the largest proportion of immigrants in the United States, but migrants from Asia are now neck and neck with them, according to the study. ", Related: How Koreans energized this Maryland city ," The report also found that some of the characteristics of Mexican immigrants currently living in the United States have changed. It found that they are more settled, older and better educated than they were 10 years ago. ","

Step 1: Don't look to r/Askreddit for dating advice,Step 2: Don't look to reddit for dating advice,Step 3: Don't be ugly.,Have you ever got girls come over to you to say ''omg you are so handsome lets fuck'' I dont think so either.,"I said don't be ugly, not be totally awesome sexy. It's different.","Also, it was a joke. The real advice is be yourself and relax.",Yeah thats the answer.I heard so many times ''looks matter''thing I get irritated.Women have so many other things on their mind other than looks.,"Step 1 have a girlfriend, then more girls ask you to be their girlfriend.  It's like work experience and how jobs want you to have some before you have one.","How many girls had you asked last 6 months? Do you ask out of the blue? I want to ask out to strangers like ''thatwasepic''youtube channel did, I need to grow balls of steel.That dude's confidence level is sky high","I mean what's the worst that could happen, they say no.  As long as you don't pester them they will forget about you and it's not a big deal, if they say yes you go for it.  But don't ask them to be your girlfriend, ask them on a date in a unique way.  Step 1 of course is be attractive.","Yes,I think exactly like you but in the moment I can't bring myself to do it.",With a name like badass monk what about a woman rejecting you could make you worry? You’re bad ass bro! If they say no it’s their loss not yours!,haha thank you my man we all gonna make it somehow,100%,Hit the gym New hairstyle Fix facial hair Trim/shave body hair,"Then what,I'm ripped af but as long as I avoid girls like I would run from rapists or serial killers thats not gonna happening.","No amount of lifting can cure autism, my brethren...",Can confirm.,/fit/ is leaking,"Well if you just wanna get laid hang with the crew, go to meets bars parties etc.","If your looking for a real long lasting just be patient and meet new people, I would say don’t flex your abs or etc bc that’s a perk of what you have not you","Why do you avoid girls in the first place, aren't you contradicting yourself with that statement? How old are you, hope you are not trolling.","I'm being honest I'm just fear from them since childhood,I'm an adult.","Then maybe you are lacking testosterone, I would get that tested if I were you. That could cause lack of self confidence imo. Sometimes you just have to put yourself right in front of their face and start talking about anything really, but don't be too eager, just be like nonchalant and laid back.","You need to show that you are not nervous when you are around them, they will sense that shit like eagles sense mice running.","Make some small talk with average girls first, then try to have 2-3 girls that you are on cool terms with while you hang out at work / school whatever, this signals other girls that you are being social.","Some young guy asked me your original question while we were shooting shits between guys, with a bit of thinking I told him: ""You need to not want to have a gf in order to get a gf."" At the time the young guy gave me a confused look, as if I was joking. But if you think about it, that's the mental state you need to be in order to be attractive, again girls will sense this in a guy they are around. This will create attraction and curiosity in them, which from where your job will be smooth sailing.","Be social at the right places. Find a sport, like climbing, jogging or other activity you know is grouped up with women and men, work for charity once a month, take a first aid cours.","Love yourself as much as possible. Respect yourself and get the health that comes with an exercised body and mind. Eat as good as you would want your loved ones to eat for them to live forever. Don't do stupid shit that you wouldn't want the people you love to do. Be trustworthy, loving, devoted, as you would like the person you love to be. You get it.","At this point, you will realize that even doing all that still no girl wants to be your girlfriend, because there is no safe way to a relationship. However, doing all that will make sure that you are someone worthy to try a relationship with.","Step 2: Giving up on women because they regardless see you as mentally weak, socially stupid, un-ambitous, dispassionate and too average looking. Sorry for being pissy i just need to vent my angst haha.","You see, man, I would have thought like that some time ago, but it's incredible just the sheer amount of women in this planet. To think that all of them will see you as what you describe (which most probably it's not that true anyway) is to be naive. You are being hard on yourself and that is stopping you from growing as a person, because you think that you can't grow anymore.",Fuck that.,"You might think that you are a shitty, average human, but the truth is that just your potential, not what you are right now, makes you as far from average as you want it to be. You don't have to adjust to a mental ""wellness"", a social ""standard"" or an ambitious work ethic. You don't even have to be a good looking aryan god to be a valid person.","You be you, and be your best you. Try to be the less shitty version of you. Make an effort to make the best of what you love and the best of who you are.","If you think women are the problem, some of them might be, and I'm sorry that you got that experience, but there's nice girls all around who would kill for a nice, average looking, awkward guy with similar tastes.","Don't shut the doors and blame the world, because you have the key. Sometimes keeping them open is a burden, but you will learn in time that some people may come in, some may not, but at least you gave an opportunity to all of them to come into your home.",PM if you want to vent further.,Thank you thats the spirit I need.,"Got your back, bro",Watch her sleep,Dude what?,Also steal some cables from her car. Being some pale recluse helps as well.,"Time, care, patience and a soundproof room are the key to true love.","No fifty shades of Gray here, that's not a true love story.","Make sure you haven't showered, and cut yourself a little. Being a pale recluse who stinks and is covered in blood helps as well.","Walk up to random girls with a rag in your hand, say excuse me, when they turn around, take a tentative sniff at the rag, then ask them ""Does this smell like chloroform to you?""","Be clean, don't be creepy, ask out women.","Be clean check, don't be creepy check ask out women?Only could do that","Ask her out for a coffee, it ain't rocket science dude.","Do you do that on strangers?İf I live in USA I would do all day since girls are too friendly there,There arent any women around me so only option is cold approaches.But damn hard to do.","Cold opens are tricky, and I don't like them, speaking as a woman. But there's always options to make them less cold. First, go to places where women are, social and activity clubs, bars and pubs, sports centres with team games you can join. Suddenly, you have insta-things in common!",As for the actual asking out?,"So, say, person I meet at an activity club, I'll want a short conversation to check we don't clash personality wise, then a no pressure invite to some sort of eatery, coffee shop, ice cream parlour, etc. If the girl you ask turns you down, back off and let her make the next move. She might still be interested but want to scope you out a bit more first, so not coming off as an entitled jerk is important, and it's good manners too.","If I meet someone at a pub or bar, I think buying her a drink is a classic. It's a clear sign she's being hit on, and puts the ball in her court to accept or refuse. If you get a yes, let her order and watch it get made, so there's no implication anythings been put in the drink. Be charming, but not fawning - any girl who wants to be treated like a princess full time, and any guy who says he'll treat you like a princess is yellow flag territory, tread with care. Try to make her laugh, compliment her, look for reciprocal conversation and body language. If she's touching her hair, putting a hand on your shoulder, leaning forward, that's good. Ask if she'd like to go to dinner sometime. Again, if you're turned down, take it graciously. Jerks are a turn off.","Hell, I was in a long queue once, got talking to the guy behind me and he charmed me into a date. Didn't go anywhere because he was from another country and I'm not into LDR, but the date was great.","It can be done. You've got the onus on you, as a man, to be the one doing the asking, and I do get that the prospect of being turned down is intimidating and can be a blow to the ego. But remember, any relationship is reciprocal. It's as much about her as it is about you, if you don't get a yes. There are way more factors at play than just yourself, and your charms. So don't take it to rough, okay?",Good luck.,"I live in Turkey,there are not any pub or bars around me,also right minded,smart,balanced people don't go there,it is not like England/Usa,Bars have a bad name,and even in bars women turn down men so badly.İn here people don't mingle they just talk to their friends and all they do is sit and talk.Consider like Starbucks.Cafe culture is dominant all over everywhere.I can say our society is not used to talking to strangers only social circles do well.My work consist of all men and my only activity is gym.İn the gym sure there are some girls,but also looks of other man.İt's closed environment that can be negative judging so easily.I don't know what I can do.I don't have any social media so another door is closed","Then we've got a cultural mismatch, and my advice won't be too helpful to you. Sorry dude. Just don't give up on yourself, you'll find someone eventually.","Be satisfied and confident with yourself, that attracts people in general.","Also, putting effort in looking good cannot harm",Lots of money and social media on point.,"Step one: Be attractive, step two: Don't be unattractive. Seriously girls are willing to put up with so much more shit from attractive people","Even if you are Brad Pitt&shy&insecure if you don't talk to them,I don't think they will do the hard things for you.You have to still be the man ask out, take phone number, set up a date, be the first to kiss...There isn't any girl doing cold approaches to guys since men don't have the value as women.Also they don't have to, guys come to them all the time.","Lawl, not all women are wall flowers waiting for you to approach","well, %98 waits,%2 likes you way too much.","Random question, what country are you from?",Turkey.,Got it,Club her over the head and drag her by the hair back to your cave.,Don't be a Nice Guy™ ,"Yeah I could have Nice Guy Syndrome,too shame can't become bad boy later.","When I was 22, I was addicted to crack and heroin. My neighbor was an old polish lady who would bang on the wall when I played music to loud. When things got real bad for me, she must have known I was hurting and not eating because she started ringing my bell and giving me sandwiches she'd made, or bags of bagels and containers of soup and stuff. She would sit with me and we would eat together. I never understood a word she said because she spoke really bad english.",She really gave me hope in humanity which is something I desperately needed at the moment. I always remember her.,Also- just celebrated 7 years clean and sober.,Edit: Thanks for all the nice comments! You guys made me go back and delete all my embarrassing posts in other subreddits. I'm gonna go find my old neighbor and thank her. I'll be back with an update!,"I'm not sure this is the right thread but good for you man,beautiful experience.",So where’s the part that actually has something to do with the post and not attention whoring,"1 - Make a good, interesting, successful, engaged life for yourself.",2 - Ask a woman to go on a date with you.,"3 - Repeat step 2 until you find a woman you think is worthwhile and who thinks you are, too.",*Be attractive,*Don't be ugly,"also, be confident bro s?",Confidence.,Making friends and having an active social life.,"Honestly, here's the easiest, most reliable basics: 1) have good personal hygiene 2) dress and groom yourself the same way you would want a girlfriend to. Are you seeking out women who have hairy legs, wear moomoos and crocs? No? Then don't expect anyone to want you looking that way either. 3) have a job, or at least a fulfilling duty or purpose in life such as full time school or volunteer work or whatever. You need to show you have motivation to complete a task and the self discipline and commitment to keep doing it. Nobody wants to date a bum. 4) just try asking the person out. Just try to put yourself out there and ask someone if they're interested in a coffee or whatever. The worst that can happen is that person says no thankyou. Most people are not going to reply in a rude manner. We're all humans who want to be treated nicely.","Much like a job, it's easier to get a girlfriend when you have a girlfriend.",Don't talk about sex/porn from the get-go. It is better if you dont talk about it at all.,Dress well and have a decent haircut.,"Be honest, truthful and confident.",Be a Minecraft youtuber,"Be interesting and do things around people. Join a meetup group on meetups.com or just engage in a group activity (even something like finding a cafe you like, etc). Plus, when you're doing things you like, you're happier and more attractive.","What not to do: focus on the need for a girlfriend. We can smell it on you. It smells like boring. Be interesting instead. That smells like... I dunno, whatever attractive smells like.","Well, strike up a conversation with a woman and actually talk to her like she's a real person. It's a funny thing, but they tend to like that. Sooner or later you'll find someone with whom you have chemistry.",I don't know have a bunch of fucking money and be very attractive?,Other then your just going to have get to know a girl and build a relationship like everyone else there really isn't a trick to this lol,"I have lots of money and fancy car,never matter to them though.I lack the action of approaching/talking/making eye contact/ to them.",Be cool,"Nocturnally emit, upon them.","Walk up to her with a piece of wheat in your mouth, torn up woodcutter clothes and an old-ass trucker cap and ask her if she sells cars, because you need a pick-up.","Be interesting, be busy.",There is no sure way. Women are not prizes to be won or got.,"Try not to approach women with the motive of trying to get them to be your romantic partner. Rather, get to know women as people/individuals, if you have shared interests maybe you’ll become friends.",You might even meet someone who does become romantically interested in you. If not you’ll have a friend.,What if there is no shared interests.,"Then decide if they’re a good friend to you, and consider if you’re a good friend for them. (Hint: if you’re only being friendly to ‘win’ them over for romance you’re not being a good friend).",Someone could have all the same interests as you and still never click romantically. But you’ll have more chance of meeting someone who genuinely cares and respects you if you genuinely care and respect them (and their boundaries).,"I didn’t become a good partner until I worked on becoming a good person. Once I became okay with my self, and filled my life with other achievements (study, travel, platonic friends) I stopped being needy and found someone who was awesome.",Only works in USA.Here girls don't give a shit if you have a dog or not.,Lol.why not.,"There is no sure fire way. Women are individuals and there is no ""1 weird trick"" and they are not obliged to go out with you",There's things you can do that can improve your odds but at the end of the day it's still a roll of the dice... it helps if you take care of yourself and have the same interests as the woman your asking out.,Stop looking for a girlfriend.

My advice was aimed to people that find it hard to find a partner because one of two things is causing this, they either aim too high or aim too infrequently. If they can do better they will eventually. It's like finding a job in that it is far easier to find a new job when you are employed rather than unemployed. Aiming low is relative anyway.

"Guilty until proven innocent? I tried to sell my MacBook using Craigslist, then three cops showed up, handcuffed me, and put a weapon to my back.","Joshua Taylor listed his old MacBook on Craigslist for extra cash. But after meeting a potential buyer at a coffee shop, the 25-year-old was detained by officers—two dressed in tactical gear and a third in plainclothes—from the Atlanta Police Department. Taylor would soon learn he was the target of a mysterious, and botched, sting operation. ","The architecture student is the son of Goldie Taylor, a political commentator and editor-at-large for The Daily Beast. On Monday, Taylor released a statement saying police never identified themselves, acted without probable cause, enacted a warrantless search and used a decoy to lure her son to Caribou Coffee in the Buckhead business district. ",Taylor tells his story to The Daily Beast.,"I work for a set design company and was short on cash. My job was supposed to be super busy for the summer but I haven’t been full-time. My dad had given me his extra computer, so I decided to sell mine: a 14-inch, 2012 MacBook Pro. At the time, it was the highest model and I used it for architecture school.","I’ve posted things on Craigslist before and hadn’t had any issues. This was probably my fifth or sixth time. I’ve listed iPods or old gaming systems and never had any issues. This is the most expensive item I’ve ever sold. The ad said “$1,000 or best offer.” It was very basic, with two pictures, and I said you’d need an install disk to use the laptop. I got three initial responses. The first person who answered offered $900. But when I provided the computer’s serial number, the buyer found out it didn’t meet their specifications.","After that fell through, I got an email from a “Derek Charleston.” He offered $950. We began talking about meeting up, and the entire process never seemed suspicious at all. But he was dead set on meeting Thursday of last week and said it was for work reasons. I guess it was how “they” were setting things up. They needed that time. I was available Sunday, Monday, every day. I kept asking him, “Are you available today? Are you around?” Then I wouldn’t get a response until eight or nine hours later. He would just keep reiterating that he was available Thursday.","We met at a Caribou Coffee at 2 p.m. He was in his early to mid-thirties, with long brown hair past his shoulders. He kind of looked like Chris Ferguson, the poker player, a Cowboy-looking guy. He had light facial hair and sunglasses on. He was just sitting on the patio outside there and didn’t have coffee. It was me, him, and probably six to seven other groups of people. When I sat down, Derek said he worked with computers but didn’t mention any specifics. Nothing seemed weird at all.","I sat across from him, pulled out the computer and he opened it up. I’ve already told everyone they needed an install disk, because I moved all the information to my dad’s computer and the laptop’s operating system was gone. The only information would be the factory information about the computer. But instead of using an install disk, he attached a portable hard drive. He said it would take a couple minutes, so we started talking and I showed him the MacBook’s case, the extension cord, and the keyboard cover. I just wanted to make sure he had everything.","We’re just sitting there, and suddenly I’m approached from behind by an officer, or I think it’s an officer. He immediately orders, “Put your hands behind your back! Put your hands behind your back!” and he has something pressed into my back. I look over my shoulder and can see a big yellow Taser.","I first put my hands above my head, then had to lower them so he could handcuff me. Everyone at Caribou was staring at me. Time ceased for a few seconds. Then a woman approached on my left side. Both of them are dressed in tactical gear, with button-up shirts and khaki pants underneath. The woman asks Derek, “Is this the one?” “Yeah, I don’t know. Hold on just a second,” Derek says. ",The female cop started asking me questions: “Where did you purchase it? What are you doing with this computer?” She was trying to get background information. I said I bought it in 2012 for architecture school. That this is my property. I broke down what I’d been using it for. ,"I was detained by Taser-point and handcuffed the entire time, while Derek was still accessing the computer. Derek tells the woman the C-number is off. Not the serial number—they were looking for some other number in the computer. ","After Derek said it wasn’t the right number, the officer with the Taser told me to stand up and removed my handcuffs. The female officer only said, “Sorry. These things happen.” I started breaking down. I knew it could happen, but I also knew how wrong this was. I immediately felt so powerless and I wanted to get out of there. I asked no questions.","When I first got to Caribou Coffee, I noticed a brand-new silver Mercury with the windows blacked out, parked three cars down from me. It was so obvious, like every other undercover car you’ve ever seen. I said to myself, “Oh, yeah, oh the cops are getting coffee” and joked, “Oh, someone’s going down today.”","I started laughing as I reached my car, because I didn’t think it would ever be me. I immediately got out of there. I just had a Taser in my back. You don’t put those that close to somebody. It’s a long-range device, designed to disable from 15 to 20 feet. I was unarmed, so there was no reason I should have had a Taser in my back.","They never said anything like, “Federal agents. Hands up!” It was just, “Hands up! Where’d you get this computer?” Then, “Sorry, have a good day.” They never said who they were. You always just listen to a person who has a weapon. You don’t know how they’re feeling or how their day is going. I shut up and just went with the flow. I was completely defenseless and did my best not to move. ","As I was walking to my car, the female officer was walking toward the silver Mercury. I asked, “Is this yours?” She said yes and that she was sorry. I started to cry. “I’m just trying to pay my bills and everything,” I told her. She tried to console me a little bit, before the cop with the Taser approached. A third undercover officer came out from the coffee shop, too. They all left in the same vehicle, while Derek left in another direction.","As I drove around the corner, I knew I needed to call someone and to return to the scene for more information. But they were already gone. There were no visible security cameras looking onto the patio either.","There’s still some gravity to this situation that I didn’t understand. I’ve got a lot of people talking about me and talking about Trayvon Martin and similar cases. That’s not a club I want to be in. I’m a light-complexioned black man, but that doesn’t feel comforting; it’s one of my biggest fears. It doesn’t make you feel good to think this happened to you, even though a lot of good things may come of this.","When I opened the computer up again, it showed me the standard desktop. On the righthand side was the name of a company in town that does technology services. The disk utility was open, and the disk doctor app was open. Derek had checked something in my disk utility system and didn’t fully eject his hardware.","The background of the computer had a bunch of saved icons with different numbers, such as Install 10.4 or Install 10.5. The logos were for OS X Snow Leopard or OS X Mountain Lion. But a lot of them had cover pictures of Elijah Woods from The Lord of the Rings for one system, or Tom Cruise as his Top Gun character for OS X Mavericks.","I called the technology company, and they had no idea about this kind of software. I gave them some vague information, then I opened up a little bit more about the story. A guy from the company said, “Oh, that’s really interesting. That’s crazy that happened to you. If I hear anything, I’ll get back to you.’”","The next day, Derek emailed me. It was completely unexpected. He went into detail about his situation, saying he’d been robbed and someone stole his laptop that had a lot of personal information about him on it. He also said he’d gone through a divorce and he’d been homeless and all kinds of other things. “If I told you everything, you’d think my life was a movie,” he claimed. He said he contracts for the technology company, which does IT solutions, but that they had no involvement.","Derek said he contacted police after finding my ad on Craigslist. He went on to say how he worked with the police, but he blamed them for moving too quickly. He said any action should be directed at them and that he sympathizes with my situation. He said he’s been in my shoes before, but didn’t elaborate. The police, he said, set up this whole game plan but just didn’t follow it down to the last few minutes. I guess he was supposed to go on my computer, and once he found the code he was looking for, he would either A) make a transaction and I would be arrested for selling stolen goods to him or B) he would make a motion and cops would come over. This is what I’m assuming. The cops didn’t even wait to move in.","In this guy’s case, he could have easily gone onto Apple.com and checked his receipt and compared serial numbers and we never would have been in this situation. If he bought his Apple products, he could log in and check his old receipts and old purchases. It would show the serial number, the one I provided the day before meeting him. It’s lazy police work. If they would have done this cop work, we wouldn’t be here. ","They wasted man-hours and three to four cops, all because I tried to sell my own computer. I didn’t even know what officers detained me. For all I knew, it could have been the Secret Service. If someone steals your iPhone, you don’t get to walk down the street and point at everyone with an iPhone. I don’t understand how police got involved to run a sting operation in the first place. The effort level doesn’t make sense. It seems like they were looking for something more or something else.","All the unknowns just don’t feel good. Unfortunately, you’ve got a lot of police misconduct, but I never thought it would be on this level. You hear about disagreements between people and single officers, but you never hear about a full setup operation. It’s completely against everything they ever teach you about what this country stands for. You’re innocent until proven guilty. I was guilty until proven innocent. ",As told to Kate Briquelet

,,,,,,"Make no mistake: Drones are coming, and they're going to change a lot of things about how we shape our lives. So why shouldn't we change how we shape our buildings to get ready for them?",Early adopters will probably buy personal flying vehicles in the not too distant future. Some models are being developed as we speak. Maybe an innovative architectural firm will even pitch the idea of building a ‘drone-ready’ condo tower in Japan or Dubai in the coming months—and maybe it will sell faster than we think.,"A mechanical engineer and a member of the family whose aerospace and transportation company builds trains, planes, and snowmobiles, Bombardier's actually at his best when he ignores pesky things like budgets, timelines, and contemporary physics. Since 2013, he's run a blog cataloging more than 200 concepts, each a fantastic, farfetched new way for people to travel through land, air, water, and space. His ideas are most certainly out there, but it's Bombardier's sort of creative thinking that keeps us moving forward.","That's the basis for my Drone Tower, which would look like a futuristic condo building, with large balconies built to accommodate small electric aircraft or shipping drones. You wouldn't need to buy your own drone, you'd simply order a ride with an app like a taxi—and hop in right from your terrace.","Of course this calls for rigorous safety standards, for the building as well as the increase in air traffic around residential buildings. If space is a bit tight, design railings that can slide down into the floor, or just use my idea for the Teatrix, robotic furniture that can move and modify itself, to scoot out of the way when an inbound vehicle is approaching.","Large balconies are always welcome in swanky condos, but they could be so much more if they obliterated your need to use the stairs or elevator, or to even get in a car or subway to reach your office tower.","I developed the Drone Tower concept in collaboration with Ashish Thulkar, an industrial designer from Bengalore, India. He also created the concept of the Escatek airport quick boarding system and the Metroshop commercial commuting train.","Perhaps the most audacious product on display at CES 2016 is Ehang's concept autonomous single-occupancy drone, the 184. The $200,000 to $300,000 helicopter will offer rides up to 23 minutes at the push of a smartphone app button.",CNMN Collection,© 2018 Condé Nast.

"Boston's police do not want to be accountable for their actions: not a single officer volunteered to participate in a pilot program for the force's bodycams, which will now be randomly distributed.","The Boston Globe reports [Police Commissioner William ] Evans made the comments Tuesday during his monthly ""Ask the Commissioner"" interview on WGBH-FM's Boston Public Radio.

The rollout date for the pilot program is Sept. 1.",The Boston Herald reports that they're still trying to find a way to avoid wearing the cameras.,"Patrolman’s Association President Patrick M. Rose has said forcing officers to wear body cameras goes against the deal the union reached with the department. Rose did not respond to requests for comment yesterday. ...

" Parental breakups, not unemployment, are given in a new report as the prime cause of New Zealand's high rate of child poverty."," The report, published today by the Family First lobby group, says the near-trebling of sole parents from 10 per cent of families with dependent children in 1976 to 28 per cent of families in the last two censuses is ""the elephant in the room"" in the child poverty debate."," Child poverty has tracked sole parenting almost exactly. Children in homes earning below 60 per cent of the median household income rose from 14 per cent in 1982 to 30 per cent in 2001, then declined to 22 per cent by 2007, although they have risen again recently."," ""The correlation between sole parent and child poverty rates is stronger than between unemployment and child poverty rates,"" says the report, by welfare commentator Lindsay Mitchell."," ""Unemployment, low wages, high housing costs and insufficient social security benefits are consistently blamed for child poverty, yet a major culprit (if not the major culprit) is family malformation, that is, a lack of two married committed parents."""," Sole parents are naturally poorer than couples, on average, because they have only one potential income earner who often can't work fulltime because of the children."," In 2014, 62 per cent of sole parents' children lived in homes earning less than 60 per cent of the median income, compared with only 15 per cent of children in two-parent homes."," The report links the rise of separated parents to the growing acceptance of living together outside formal marriage. Children born to legally married couples plunged from 95 per cent of births in 1961 to 51.3 per cent in 2010, before recovering in each year since then to 53.5 per cent in the latest March year."," For Maori, children born to legally married parents collapsed even more spectacularly from 72 per cent of Maori births in 1968 to just 20.9 per cent in 2011, recovering to 21.6 per cent in the latest year."," The report quotes Australian data showing that de-facto couples are much more likely than married couples to break up within five years, and that the five-year separation rate increased much faster for de-facto couples (from 25 per cent in the 1970s to 38 per cent in the 1990s) than for married couples (from 7 per cent to 9 per cent)."," It says another factor promoting separation was the creation of the sole parent benefit in 1974, making parents who are both unemployed better off by splitting to get two separate benefits."," This factor was more important when unemployment was high in the 1990s, and the decline in unemployment since may help to explain the recent slight decline in sole parenting."," However, Dr Susan St John of the Child Poverty Action Group said the report ignored the fact that marriage was not always good for women or their children."," ""Intimate partner violence is not mentioned, nor the high rate of incarceration, especially of Maori males,"" she said. ""The policy implications of this report, to reduce the safety net yet further and stigmatise the unwed, are extremely dangerous."""
3 Min Read,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A group of former Skype technologists, backed by the co-founder of the messaging platform, has introduced a new version of its own messaging service that promises end-to-end encryption for all conversations, including by video. ","Wire, a 50-person start-up mostly made up of engineers, is stepping into a global political debate over encryption that pits privacy against security advocates, epitomized by the standoff between the U.S. government and Apple. ",The company said on Thursday it was adding video calling to a package of private communications services that go beyond existing messaging providers. ,"Rivals such as Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp or  Telegram offer encryption on only parts of a message’s journey or for a specific set of services, it said.  ","Wire, which is based in Switzerland relays communications through its network of cloud computers but user communications are stored, in encrypted form, on their own devices. It delivers privacy protections that are always on, even when callers use multiple devices, such as a phone or desktop PC simultaneously.  ","This comprehensive approach poses fresh challenges to law enforcers, who often seek to exploit gaps in encryption in  criminal or security investigations. ","“We believe Wire is unique in the industry with always-on encryption for all conversation(s), in groups or 1:1, with simultaneous support for multiple devices,” Wire Chief Technology Officer Alan Duric said in a statement. ","“Everything is end-to-end encrypted: That means voice and video calls, texts, pictures, graphics - all the content you can send,” Wire Executive Chairman Janus Friis told Reuters. ","The Danish entrepreneur was a co-founder of Skype, first released in 2003, which was later sold to a series of owners and is now a unit of Microsoft Corp. ","Wire launched the first version of its self-titled communications app late in 2014 to limited notice because it offered encrypted calling and text services similar to a dozen other apps, distinguished mainly by crystal-clear voice quality.  ","The app relies on standard, open-source encryption techniques, which allows outside technical experts to evaluate the security of its products rather than relying on trust. ",Technical details can be found at wire.com/privacy/ ,"Wire receives financial backing from Iconical, a group of designers, engineers and executives that act as alternative to traditional venture capital investors. Friis invests in Wire as part of Iconical. ","It has not disclosed how much funding it has received. A key selling point for Wire is that it protects users from advertising. Like many start-ups in this area, it is seeking to grow quickly and discover a sustainable business model later.

"Hi! I hope this is okay, I wasn't really sure where else to post this.","A tiny bit of backstory, then it will get super relevant, I promise. I started dating this wonderful guy. First thing he told me was that he had ended a relationship months ago but didn't have the heart to kick her out since she had no where to go and she is in his extra room. Okay, fine. We've been dating for a while now and I did eventually come over one weekend when she was out of town so that we weren't rubbing anything in her face.","When I show up I see her cat which they had been trying to rehome. My boyfriend made it very clear to her that it was HER cat and she would be taking care of her. So when I see this, I'm alarmed. The TWO litter boxes (for just her) are FULL of cat poop. The cat looks pretty miserable and is constantly begging for attention. I have always been a cat person and this hit home for me.","I would also like to mention, I realize this is partly his fault for letting it go on regardless of their relationship and have told him I was disappointed in that. About a week passes and I begged him to get her to clean it or just do it himself. This cat didn't choose that life. The next time I was over nothing had changed so I decided to take her home with me because I couldn't watch this kitty get neglected any further.","Prior to this I have had my own cat since he was two months old. He is now seven months. I also have a roommate with two pugs who chase and are too rough so I am pretty much confined to keeping him in my room all the time. I wasn't able to introduce them well and they are now fighting. They don't ever fight over food or territory, but the older cat will literally walk up to mine on purpose and just hiss and attack. She is already very possessive of me so she gets jealous when he even comes near me. He is scared of her. He has given her plenty of distance, not gone after her, and been very sweet.","Anyway, I still believe I did the right thing here. Even though this situation isn't ideal for her, it is still better than her living in her own filth like she was. I just cannot keep her. I work from home, nights, so they fight while I'm on the phone working, they wake me up at 5:30AM doing so. I am one of those people, once I'm up, I'm up but I work until midnight and I just can't be doing this.","I've called around, it's apparently kitten season and no kill shelters are full. I've asked family and friends to no avail. I just don't know what to do. I could take her to my local shelter which has great adoption rates, but even then it would be a $40 fee and I'm already hesitant about it.",TL;DR - Rescued a cat from a bad home but cannot keep her and not sure where to go from here.,Let me give you some free advice: Don't date someone who does not have the decency to take care of an animal whether they like the animal or not. That tells you everything you need to know about that person.,"Why don't you take her to the vet first and then try and spread the news, maybe one of your neighbors/friends would like to have a new friend? I myself have taken a stray cat barely a week ago, now she owns an enclosed place in my backyard because I'm not sure either how will my another two behave when they will first meet... By the way, you sure did the right thing.","I have asked around a bit with family and friends, on Facebook. Unfortunately I live in a two bedroom apartment with a roommate and her two dogs that pretty much get free run of the house (don't even get me started on how unfair it is here lol), two hamsters, and of course my seven month old rescue kitten I did adopt.","She's going to stay here until I can figure something out, but with the way they fight 100% of the time, it keeps me up and isn't conducive to my working at home. I had a friend suggest giving her own space, but the only place I have that has a door is my bathroom or closet and I'm not making this cat live in a closet.","Even though I know this isn't her forever home, I do know even fighting with my cat is better than she was before.",I've called two different county's Humane Society and they basically laughed in my face and told me 'to try to keep her' or drop her off at a shelter with a good adoption rate so maybe she won't be put down. My boyfriend called SPCA who wouldn't take her and said he should just put her outside since technially that is considered 'humane'. I am appalled by the reactions of these 'rescue groups' to be honest.,"I don't mind taking care of her until I can find her a place but with them not letting me sleep and getting loud while I work I'm not sure how much longer I can stay sane. My own kitty has always had abandonment issues because of what happened to him before me. I work from home and stay home at least four days a week. I usually don't even leave the house but twice a week so I feel trapped. I have no car and live in a rough neighborhood so I feel like they're constantly fighting and I can't get away from it, which I know is making it worse that there's literally no escaping it.","You're a great, kind-hearted person! Indeed this poor kitty is better with you rather than in the streets again. I hope everything will work out eventually. Btw, that's really unfair that two dogs are running around the house and the poor kitties should live in a closet. When I adopted my second kitty my first one was jealous too$ he even scratched me when he smelled my hands after I petted the second cat. It's pure instinct, when cats are fighting for power in a house. Maybe try feeding them together (so that they get distracted by food and not by each other's presence), try and switch things they sleep on so that they get familiar with the other cat's smell. I'd also recommend using a spray bottle every time one cat decides to humiliate another - it's harmless but shameful","They generally settle their differences when I give treats until the older cat decides she's over it and starts hissing over nothing. They will be near each other if I pet them both at the same time but generally they won't be near each other without this new kitty getting upset over nothing. My cat has given her space, doesn't try to eat her food, doesn't attack or make any noises. Sometimes she will literally walk wherever he is and start going off.","I would assume if I gave it a ton more time MAYBE they could work things out, but it all seems to be her problem and I can't be up at 5:30am and work until midnight every night :( She's adorable and again, can stay until I find her a better situation, but I'm so frustrated with her. I try not to show it because I know cats can pick up on that, but she doesn't seem to be stressed or scared, she just seems like she has a huge attitude and wants me all to herself 100% of the time.","If youre on Facebook see if there's a swip swap page for your area. In the post mention you want references and a small rehoming fee, this keeps weirdos and shitheads from taking her. Once yoy find the right person dont take the money or donate it to the local shelter.",992k,Subscribers,2.1k,Online,"Pictures, videos, articles and questions featuring and about cats."

" ""You're not actually a man"", was the reason allegedly given to a transgender person by a North Shore barber who refused to cut their hair."," Lorren Grabarek was born female but identifies as neither male nor female - otherwise known as gender queer or non-binary, falling under the transgender umbrella and preferring the gender-neutral pronoun ""they"".", Grabarek wanted a short back and sides ahead of their 22nd birthday and on Sunday went to The Corner Shop Barber in Birkenhead.," ""The shop was empty when I arrived, there was a woman sitting down. She looked at me and I sat down next to her."," ""She was wearing an apron ... I asked her if she worked there and she was like, 'I am, but I can't serve you',"" Grabarek said."," Asked why not, the staffer allegedly said ""because you're not actually a man, so I can't cut your hair""."," Grabarek explained that they were getting a men's haircut, but said the staffer asked if Grabarek was female."," ""I didn't want to sit there and explain gender queer and non-binary gender identities ... so I just walked out. I just didn't know what to do after that.""", Grabarek said it was discouraging to be treated that way.," ""I spend so much time trying to present myself in a way that will get me by with the least amount of comments and stares, and in a way that will give me confidence."""," Grabarek said to be told that their presentation was not ""good enough or real enough"" was hurtful."," They said not conforming to a male or female gender, but rather being somewhere in between, was stressful enough without having trouble doing simple things."," ""It takes a couple of days to work up the courage to go get a haircut.""", Grabarek said they had since spoken to friends who had similar issues trying to get haircuts at different barber shops.," ""It's bizarre. You're still cutting short hair.""", Grabarek planned to make a complaint to the Human Rights Commission.," Grabarek eventually found a man -- Bob Singh, a barber in Birkenhead -- to provide the haircut."," ""A living person is a living person, doesn't matter what you are -- gay, straight or whatever -- I'll cut anyone's hair,"" he said."," When queried about the incident, Corner Shop Barber owner Laurel Hall said, ""We've never ever done women's hair, love""."," She said she had worked on Sunday with another staff member, but did not remember Grabarek.", Ms Hall said the staff member was out of town and unable to comment.," If a woman wanted a male haircut, Ms Hall said she would do it, but went on to say ""we have traded here for 80 years as a barber shop. Barbers. We employ barbers. It's not unisex.""", University of Auckland Human Rights Law Centre director Rosslyn Noonan said without knowing the exact details of the incident it was hard for her to say whether there had been unlawful discrimination.," ""Transgender people have every right to identify with what they believe is their rightful gender, and it's not for you or me to judge that."""

by Jonathan Cheban,"The easiest way to cut down on expenses is by having a travel companion. This way you can share accommodation, transport and meals. You might even get deals for sharing. You will be splitting the costs of most things making the experience a lot less costly.
","Be careful who you take as a travel companion. This needs to be someone that has a lot of the same interests as you do. You need to get along quite well with this person so that the trip doesn’t become unpleasant later on.
","If you’re trying to see the world but you don’t want to break the bank you might have to compromise on accommodation. Hotels are the obvious choice for tourists. They’re recognised institutions with great service but that service comes at a price.
","A much cheaper option would be staying in hostels while travelling. You will be sharing dormitories with other travellers so you won’t have a lot of privacy but you’ll have a place to sleep at a fraction of the price of a hotel.
","The next best thing is a bed and breakfast. You will have your own room and each room might have its own ensuite bathroom which offers you a lot more privacy. You also get breakfast which you should take full advantage of. It saves you from spending extra money on things like snacks.
","When it comes to food, tourists often prefer to stick with what is familiar. So they will seek out a recognisable fast-food chain or look for a fancy looking restaurant in hopes that the food will not disappoint. These aren’t viable options when you’re travelling on a budget. 
eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'thedishh_com-box-3','ezslot_8']));","Save some money and immerse yourself in the culture by trying out the authentic local cuisine. Go to markets and support the street food vendors, or seek out low-cost local restaurants.
","In some countries, you can negotiate the price of almost everything. This even applies in some malls. Haggling is part of the culture.
","If you team up with other travellers you can ask for a bulk pricing on things like tours or accommodation. If you’re staying in one place for a week or longer you might be able to negotiate for a lower price on accommodation when you check in.
","Often times how much you spend on travelling is subject to when you are travelling. For instance, if you travel during off-season times you will pay less for things like flights and accommodation than you would if you travelled during peak times. The same goes for what time of the day you are travelling. 
","If you travel between off-peak hours your flights will be a lot less costly. You will save money by flying indirectly and flying to lesser known airports as well.
","Book your tickets well in advance and look for travelling deals or discounts. If you book tickets for tourist attractions beforehand you will be paying less than you would be paying on the day.
","If you’re staying within the borders of your own country the most economical way to travel is in the comfort of your own car. Get a few of your friends together, load up the car and hit the road. You can split the costs of petrol rather than buying a return plane ticket for each of you. Additionally, you can share accommodation costs, or even better, save money on accommodation and camp out in tents.","To prevent any unforeseen expenses while you are out on the road, make sure that your car is in a good condition and that your insurance payments are up to date. if you know you’re going on a trip and you are trying to save some extra money you can shop around for car insurance that suits your pocket and save some money there as well. This gives you peace of mind while you’re on the road if anything happens. ","These are just a few tips on how you can travel and see the world without breaking the bank. It’s not how much you spend that makes the trip enjoyable. It’s the experiences and the memories you make that counts.
","The past decade has seen the ascendency of pastel colors in the home. Living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, dining rooms, and bedrooms, all have been filled with the pale and neutral shades of formerly deep and earthy colors — in pursuit of what? Karma? Meaningfulness? Focus? Reduction of the carbon footprint? Today it’s hard to tell why America went for pastel house colors in such a big way, because the big bad bold colors are making a decided comeback, and people are loving it and wondering why it ever went away in the first place. IKEA has been one of the instrumental fashion influences to bring back dark colors, especially dark green. The Nordic nations never lost their love and respect for a good dark green — they use it indoors and love to exhibit on the outside of their houses as well — either as a vibrant trim or as a color-coordinated wall coating. A home with dark green, inside and/or outside, is a home full of personality.","In the bedroom a dark green, in the vicinity of forest green to emerald green, is a perfect accompaniment to the natural accents of wood grain bedsteads and dressers. Add some white trim to break the monotony, with a shading of pink (as a nod to the not-quite-extinct mania for pastels) and the bedroom becomes a soothing and steady palette that helps the tired body and weary mind slip under the covers and sleep deep.","Advances made in technology has made it possible to measure and analyze our lifestyle activities such as exercises with the aim to improve it. It has been made possible by the quantified self or what most of you would refer to as self-tracking. But, how safe is your self-tracking?","Currently, there have been security risks that have been associated with a large number of tracking devices. The reason behind the insecurity is due to the social factors and technological advances. Furthermore, stored personal data in this devices is also vulnerable to attacks.","How do different fitness trackers ensure the safety of data inside the tracker itself? What can we do as users to ensure that additional layers of security are added? Before looking at security concerns, we have to understand what quantified self-care.","Self-track is technological devices that use the concept of collecting and analyzing data to track every aspect of human life. The fitness self-track are used by people to monitor progress in heart rate, exercises among other health-related activities.",It is important to note that a report prepared by ABI indicates that the number of wearable computing devices such as self-track devices will increase by approximately 485 million devices annually in 2018.,"The huge number of people wearing the devices from top manufacturers including Samsung, and Fitbit that track their daily movement, have raised the question on safety of the devices.",The fitness self-track may come in many forms. Smartphones are currently everywhere. They have many different inbuilt tracking sensors.,"Also, most of them have self-tracking applications and due to the inclusion of sensors such as accelerometer, heart rate sensor, GPS and gyroscope they can be converted into an effective self -tracking devices. The applications used have the rights to store read and interpret the data extracted by the sensors.",Another fitness self-track devices are the wearable. These devices can be worn on the body and can also be attached to sports equipment. Wearables have sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometers that generate data., ,"The use of sensors such as GPRS makes these devices to be prone to attacks and hacking. The information that is extracted from the devices include the distance that you cover within a specific period of time; time that you go for a run; where you go running; age, sex, weight and height; the heart rate; where one lives; your attitude; when and where you go for a vacation.","This information is a goldmine for most businesses that would like to lure you into buying some of their items. Besides, the information is also essential for criminals.",The ease with which personal information is extracted from these devices is alarming. Reports indicate that an estimated 20% of fitness self-track apps were seen to transmit their passwords openly. 52% of these apps lacked policies that govern privacy.,"So, what kind of security do they offer?",Most manufacturers who provide cloud-based tracking system use the current technology of encrypted protocol. An example is the HTTPS to transfer data.,"Out of all the manufactures, only 4 providers are known to take extra caution when it comes to security issues. Despite their efforts to keep data intact and ensure that it remains unaltered, some scammers and hackers still succeed.",It is even more disappointing to realize that even novices of hackers can easily extract information from the self-track. This is because the devices lack end to end encryption or any other tamper protection measures during synchronization of data.,"Furthermore, the data stored in some of the fitness trackers that allowed synchronization of data was in plain text a form that is available for hackers to use whenever they want to.","Therefore, it is up to you to ensure that your sensitive data is protected and that no people are tracking your every move. Below are some tips on how you can protect your data.",Make sure you turn off the WIFI and the Bluetooth connection. Do this every time you are not using them as they can transmit signals which can be used by the tracker.,"If you are a person who likes having hundreds of apps in your phone, It is time you redefined your behavior as you should be careful with what that app is going to do with your data.","Some wearable such as MoveC300 watch can sync with smartphones, an iPad or iPhone device. They do not do it automatically and you will have to press the sync button when in need of transferring data from one device to the other. Such a feature makes these watches hard to hack. ","One of the world’s top luxury consignors, The RealReal, is unequivocally shifting the way we shop, accessorize and experience fashion as a whole. The company knows all too well that luxury goods will always be a global hot commodity. They want others to understand that their pre-owned luxury goods can have a resale value of up to 80 percent. The company has positively encouraged its members to resell what they no longer use instead of discarding it in the trash. This not only helps its members make a good return on their investments, but it also helps to promote recycling. ","As of today, the RealReal has over 9 million members and is reportedly worth more than $450 million. They have consigned over 8 million luxury items including ultra-rare pieces by Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Chanel, Celine, and Rolex through its online, brick-and-mortar and pop-up shops. The luxury consignor’s chief merchant for its San Francisco office, Rati Levesque, focuses on educating its merchants on what’s currently trending up or spiraling down. She uses real-time data so the sales team can decide what item’s resale price should be raised, or what item should be stored away until it’s trending again. ","The world of fashion is very fickle and ever-changing, a top designer’s piece that was once deemed outdated can make its way to the top again in an instant. And that is exactly what this company wants you to remember; your luxury goods will always have the potential to stay marketable. Levesque, an economics major, used to own an upscale boutique before she helped launched the RealReal back in 2011. The real-time data that she constantly updates her sales team with are eventually used to help each consignor successfully resell their goods. It’s up to them to let the consignors know that those fabulous pairs of Gucci boots are now selling like hotcakes, and now is the perfect time to give up a pair if they’re no longer wearing them. ","Levesque also researches the past history of any type of luxury item that was ever consigned through the company. If an item didn’t sell well in the past, it was simply because it was overpriced. They would have to price these items a bit lower in hopes to see them move out of their ever-increasing inventory. She explained that everything showcased in-store is also available online during the same time. Due to this feature, the brick-and-mortar stores have practically turned into miniature warehouses where items can be picked, packed and shipped out if needed. ","To help the sales team keep a constant eye on their inventory, the company relies on an RFID chip that is placed inside every tag. They can easily locate a vintage Louis Vuitton dress to have it shipped out immediately if it sells online. Or, if a customer takes an item in the fitting room, it will conveniently be placed on temporary hold online. The company has hired a team of stylists at their brick-and-mortar stores in New York, NY and Los Angeles, CA, to help push out inventory. They are trained to converse with their customers, in a rather tactful way, to let them know that what they’re buying will still hold its resale value and that they can make a nice profit when they’re done using it. It is a win-win situation that millions worldwide can’t help but agreed with.","Exercise has proven benefits for our physical and mental health. Despite knowing this, as many as 80% of adult Americans exercise much less than the recommended weekly, says a survey analysis published by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). ","So, if you’ve been planning to begin an exercise routine and haven’t got around to it yet, here’s something that may motivate you! Did you know that regular physical activity can improve your sex life? In fact, an exercise routine is highly recommended to improve your libido and boost your performance, even if one’s relying on top male enhancement products like Tengenix, say experts at Mens Health Digest. Also, don’t forget to read Tengenix reviews to get all the information on dosage and side effects before starting to use the product.","To begin with, exercising regularly can help control weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve your immunity. All these health benefits are important to enjoy yourself with your partner. But, that’s not all. Exercising can have a much more direct impact on your sex life. ","You don’t need to read motivational quotes or watch inspiring videos to hit the gym on a regular basis. All you need to think of is enjoying with your partner! And, that should be motivating enough to start exercising, right? So, here are three ways in which following a regular workout routine can help you satisfy yourself and your partner.","Ask your gym instructor about a good cardio workout. Keeping your heart healthy and strong will make you feel more energetic, even if you’ve had a tiring day at work. As a healthy heart keeps your body going for longer, you’ll be ready for some highly passionate foreplay. This is an important part of lovemaking that is often overlooked. When you’re ready, your heart will pump the much-need blood to the right places! That too, much more quickly than before. To this end, exercises like swimming, running and cycling have great benefits.   ","This increases testosterone levels in the body, which is responsible for your sex drive. Do be careful though, as too much strength training can have the exact opposite effect! A drop in testosterone levels is sometimes experienced by professional athletes and bodybuilders. You may be far from getting there, but it’s good to have all the information before you begin. Just as you would read reviews of top male enhancement products like Tengenix to know the right dosage and side effects, it’s also important to know enough about strength trading to make the right decision.","Did you know yoga has postures that can stimulate sexual awakening? Even if you don’t experience something that dramatic, yoga classes can relieve stress, improve focus and enhance your senses. All of these can spell wonders for your sex life. ","Finally, exercising improves flexibility, which can be a great advantage if you wish to try new positions! So, the next time you think of using top male enhancement products, do consider throwing in even a light exercise routine, to get the best of both worlds.","eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'thedishh_com-large-leaderboard-2','ezslot_6']));Has your garage door been playing tricks on you lately?  It sometimes acts lazy to let you out and other times don’t close properly?

In such cases, simply replacing the batteries can bring back the garage door into its earlier working stage.","However, in many situations, it is not the batteries that are responsible for the problems. Sometimes, even after changing the batteries the garage door won’t open or close properly. There might be other some issues that are affecting its performance. Here are some of the major garage door issues highlighted by the experts at J & J Garage Door & Electric Openers; a leading garage door repair service in Algonquin, who also provide their services in places like Palatine, Elgin, Deerfield, Northbrook, Mount Prospect, McHenry, Cary, Arlington Heights and Buffalo Grove.",Let us discuss some of the major issues that need professional attention., , ,"Usually, this happens when an object on the ground blocks the path of the invisible beam transmitted by the sensors of the s. However, it can also happen as a result of debris build-up on the tracks or sensors getting misaligned; both of which can prevent the rollers from moving forward to shut down the garage door.", , ,"Have you been listening to unusual noises every time the garage door opens and closes? This usually happens when the torsion spring of lifting cables gets broken. Since, the springs operate under immense stress; this causes unwanted noise and could pose a safety risk too.", , ,"The rollers and tracks are in operation for number of times in a day, which makes them susceptible to wear and tear. Most of the times the tracks fall out of alignment or the bolts in the brackets come loose. Sometimes, the tracks get damaged after getting bumped by the car while parking, causing additional strain in operation. All these situations can cause serious issues with the door. Contact a garage door installation and repair service before it’s too late.", , ,"Rollers come in different types, steel, nylon and plastic. All these have different life-expectancies. When installing the garage doors, people pay least attention to the material of rollers. Rollers of the garage doors need to be cleaned and lubricated every year to maintain efficiency. Not doing so shall increase the chances of having serious problems in future.", , ,"Broken and eroded seals in garage doors act as entryways for pests. They are harmful for the stuff kept in the garage. If left unaddressed, soon they’ll make their way to the interiors, causing a huge amount of damage and mess. One has to stop their entry right at the garage door.","In case you have any of the above problems, it is best to call a garage door installation and repair service in your area. These people usually have years of experience dealing with all the problems mentioned above. They’ll also be able to answer all your queries related to garage doors and their maintenance.","Helping businesses maintain adequate inventory in a secure way, warehouses are an extremely important part of any business. Leasing or purchasing a warehouse is a major business investment. Having the right warehouse space, at the best possible location, can enhance efficiency and profitability for a business. It can ensure that the company is able to compete in the market and serve their customers effectively. ","At present, the US is witnessing low vacancy and strong absorption rates, along with high demand for warehouse space. Although the conditions seem perfect for the growth of the warehousing sector in 2018, business owners need to put in some extra efforts to find the perfect space that will ensure the quickest possible delivery to customers.","As a quick suggestion, it is wise to look for warehouse space for rent in central locations like Houston, TX, which also boasts affordable prices.","So, keep these crucial aspects in mind the next time you are looking for appropriate warehouse space for rent, such as those available in Houston.","If your child finds it difficult to concentrate while studying, it is quite possible that you have tried out several natural aids by now. However, are you aware that ADDTabz is one of the strongest alternatives to Adderall? It is aimed at students who want to get a mental edge over the competition. This, in turn, helps them prepare better for tests and presentations. ADDTabz reviews point out that this brain supplement helps in increasing focus and improving cognitive abilities. Moreover, it enhances critical thinking and problem solving.","According to the unbiased reviews on Smart Pill Guide, ADDTabz can help the user concentrate for longer periods of time, without feeling anxious or getting distracted. The review also mentions that the recommended dosage is one 395 mg capsule per day. The ingredients of ADDTabz are Octopamine, DMAA, caffeine and CDP Choline, which make for a simple formula. These ingredients have a calming effect, reduce anxiety, improve focus and concentration, and reduce fidgeting. All these go towards reducing hyperactive and unfocused behaviour, which is a symptom of ADHD. Hence, ADDTabz may prove to be a safe and effective alternative to Adderall for treating ADHD. However, it is always better to consult a doctor, especially if one is taking some other medication for ADHD.",Side Effects   ,"The two major ingredients that improve cognitive performance in this supplement are CDP Choline and DMAA. DMAA is a stimulant that is similar to amphetamine. It improves focus in people suffering from ADHD or ADD. Although it works very effectively to improve concentration, the side effects of DMAA overpower its benefits, according to many users.","As of now, as many as 86 adverse reports on the side effects of DMAA have been sent to the FDA, according to ADDTabz reviews. This compound has been shown to cause side effects like seizures, heart attacks, strokes, heart palpitations, panic attacks, anxiety, nervousness and stress. These side effects could occur after you take one dose or after you take several capsules. The other nootropic ingredient, CDP Choline, can boost memory as well as  learning, by helping the brain produce acetylcholine. This chemical takes care of the brain’s cognitive functions. CDP Choline may improve the functioning of other ingredients and also prevent other side effects. The use of caffeine in ADDTabz raises a red flag. Caffeine is not recommended for children or adults suffering from ADD or ADHD, since this stimulant may cause irritability and anxiety.","Going by the potent ingredients of AddTabz, you need to consult a doctor before you use this over-the-counter medication. People with a history of heart ailments, hypertension or negative side effects such as withdrawal after taking amphetamines should not use this Adderdall alternative.","Overall, the AddTabz boosts focus as well as concentration for several hours. It may also help improve comprehension and learning skills. However, DMAA is known to cause serious side effects. Moreover, since this supplement is based on stimulants it can lead to dependency. Also, it does not create a balance between neurotransmitter levels.

DoJ indictment alleges Russian operatives ‘communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign’,"
Jon Swaine in New York and 
Marc Bennetts in Moscow","

Sat 17 Feb 2018 07.30 EST


First published on Fri 16 Feb 2018 13.08 EST

","Thirteen Russians have been criminally charged for interfering in the 2016 US election to help Donald Trump, the office of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, announced on Friday.","Mueller’s office said 13 Russians and three Russian entities, including the notorious state-backed “troll farm” the Internet Research Agency, had been indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington DC.","A 37-page indictment alleged that the Russians’ operations “included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J Trump ... and disparaging Hillary Clinton,” his Democratic opponent.","Mueller alleged that Russian operatives “communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign”, but the indictment did not address the question of whether anyone else in Trump’s team had knowingly colluded.","Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said at a press conference in Washington: “There is no allegation in this indictment that any American had any knowledge.” Rosenstein added that the charges did not mean the Russian activity had an effect on the outcome of the election. ",Trump and the White House seized on Rosenstein’s remarks to falsely claim that the indictment proved there had been no collusion and that the election result had definitely not been impacted.,"In a statement on Friday, Trump suggested that what he called “outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories” relating to possible collusion were serving to further the Russian agenda.","The Russians allegedly posed as Americans to operate bogus social media accounts, buy advertisements and stage political rallies. They stole the identities of real people in the US to post online and built computer systems in the US to hide the Russian origin of their activity, according prosecutors.","“This indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the internet,” said Rosenstein. He alleged that the Russians had “worked to promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy,” adding: “We must not allow them to succeed.”","The charges state that from as far back as 2014, the defendants conspired together to defraud the US by “impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of government” through interference with the American political and electoral processes.","One defendant, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, is accused of using companies he controlled – including Concord Management and Consulting, and Concord Catering – to finance the operations against the US. The operation at one stage had a monthly budget of $1.25m, according to Mueller, which paid for operatives’ salaries and bonuses.","Events were organised by Russians posing as Trump supporters and as groups opposed to Trump such as Black Lives Matter, according to prosecutors. One advertisement shortly before the election promoted the Green party candidate Jill Stein, who is blamed by some Clinton backers for splitting the anti-Trump vote.","In August 2016, Russian operatives communicated with Trump campaign staff in Florida through their “@donaldtrump.com” email addresses to coordinate a series of pro-Trump rallies in the state, according to Mueller, and then bought advertisements on social media to promote the events.","At one rally in West Palm Beach, a Russian operative is even alleged to have paid Americans to build a cage on a flatbed truck and to have an actor posing as Clinton in a prison uniform stand inside. ","One defendant, Irina Kaverzina, is accused of admitting her involvement in the operation and a subsequent coverup in an email to a relative in September last year, after Mueller’s inquiry had begun. “We had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity,” Kaverzina allegedly wrote, “so I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues.”",The Russians are also accused of working to suppress turnout among ethnic minority voters. They allegedly created an Instagram account posing as “Woke Blacks” and railed against the notion that African Americans should choose Clinton as “the lesser of two devils” against Trump.,"In early November 2016, according to the indictment, the Russian operatives used bogus “United Muslims of America” social media accounts to claim that “American Muslims [are] boycotting elections today.”","Following Trump’s victory, the Russian operation promoted allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic party, according to Mueller’s team. Around that time, Trump repeatedly claimed without evidence that he would have won the popular vote if not for large-scale voter fraud.","The individuals charged are Mikhail Ivanovich Bystrov, Mikhail Leonidovich Burchik, Aleksandra Yuryevna Krylova, Anna Vladislavovna Bogacheva, Sergey Pavlovich Polozov, Maria Anatolyevna Bovda, Robert Sergeyevich Bovda, Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly Aslanov, Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev, Gleb Igorevitch Vasilchenko, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin and Vladimir Venkov.","All were charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Three defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five defendants were charged with aggravated identity theft.","Separately, Mueller’s office announced that Richard Pinedo, of Santa Paula, California, had pleaded guilty to identity fraud. Pinedo, 28, admitted to running a website that offered stolen identities to help customers get around the security measures of major online payment sites. It was not made clear whether his service had been used by the Russian operatives. ","Rosenstein said no contact had been made with Russian authorities regarding the charges so far, but that US officials intended to seek extradition of the defendants.",US intelligence agencies previously concluded that Russians mounted an attack on the US election system aimed at electing Donald Trump to the presidency.,Mueller is conducting a criminal inquiry into interference by Russians and possible collusion by Trump’s campaign. Two Trump campaign advisers have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Two others have been charged with federal crimes.,"US investigators have long signalled their belief that Prigozhin, a 56-year-old billionaire businessman, is behind Russia’s internet troll factories.","Nicknamed the “Kremlin’s chef”, Prigozhin once ran Putin’s favourite restaurant in St Petersburg, after which he was awarded multi-billion pound state catering contracts.","He provided catering for Dmitry Medvedev’s presidential inauguration in 2008, and also has lucrative contracts to feed Russia’s army and Moscow’s schoolchildren.","Prigozhin, who has also been linked to the Wagner Group, a shadowy Kremlin-linked private military contractor believed to be operating in Syria, was included on a US sanctions list in July.","Speaking to the RIA Novosti state news agency on Friday, Prigozhin said: “The Americans are really impressionable people, they see what they want to see. I have great respect for them. If they want to see the devil – let them see him.”",Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the allegations “absurd”.,“Thirteen people carried out interference in the US elections? Thirteen people against special services with a budgets of billions?” she wrote in a Facebook post.,Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian media he had not yet had a chance to study the indictments.

"Panama will adopt international tax reporting standards and participate in the automatic exchange of tax information by 2018, President Juan Carlos Varela told Japanese media on Tuesday, as his country came under a harsh spotlight in the wake of revelations arising from the ""Panama Papers"" controversy.","""To prevent the illegal use of Panama's financial systems, we would like to co-operate with other countries to improve transparency,"" Varela told broadcaster NHK on Tuesday, during a visit to Tokyo.","Members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which helped establish the information-exchange scheme, will visit Panama as early as this week to negotiate specific methods for sharing information, Varela told the Nikkei newspaper.","The agreement on automatically swapping tax information, which around 100 countries have now joined, is due to come into effect in 2017. The leak of thousands of confidential documents from a Panamanian law firm earlier this month highlighted Panama's failure to cooperate in international efforts to clamp down on tax evasion by the rich and powerful.","Varela's comment comes after OECD chief Jose Angel Gurria said on Thursday that Panama has decided to adopt international tax reporting standards. Panama will also set up a committee of six to eight domestic and foreign experts within six months to make the Panamanian financial system more transparent, Varela told several Japanese media.","Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

,By Vivian Ho,Caption,Close,A San Francisco police officer was criminally charged Wednesday for alleged records violations that emerged while he was being investigated for rape. ,"Officer Jason Lai was charged with two misdemeanor counts of unlawful possession of criminal history information and four misdemeanor counts of misuse of confidential Department of Motor Vehicles information, police said. ",He was booked into County Jail after a months-long investigation that began after a woman accused him of raping her in August. ,"The woman said Lai raped her twice after a night of heavy drinking at her Sunset District home, according to an affidavit for a search warrant. Lai, an officer at Taraval Station, frequented her workplace while on patrol and had asked her to dinner. ","According to police, internal affairs investigators could not find sufficient evidence to support the rape charge, but discovered evidence of the records violations during the investigation.","Lai was released on $18,000 bail. He could not be reached for comment. ","Investigators are still looking into whether a former San Francisco police lieutenant lied and delayed the sexual assault investigation, police said. ","Curtis Liu had contacted Lai after the woman sought medical treatment a few days after the alleged assault and named him as a suspect, according to court documents.","Liu said he had called Lai as a joke because he thought the name was a coincidence, but according to investigators, he then went on to lie to his superior officers about contacting him and led them to believe he had made the proper notifications to start an investigation.","The lies and breach in protocol, according to the affidavit, not only delayed the investigation by a day but “could have assisted (the officer) in destroying and disposing of crucial evidence in this investigation.”",An attorney for Liu did not immediately return calls for comment. Police said he no longer works for the department. ,"Lai was placed on unpaid leave during the investigation, and remains on unpaid leave after his arrest. ",He is scheduled to return to court in May. ,Vivian Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: vho@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @VivianHo

" If you listened to talkback this week you'd know who's to blame for the price of Auckland's houses. It's the immigrants. They've come here with their deep pockets, snapped up multiple houses in the best parts of the city and made it impossible for young Kiwis to buy their first homes and start their families. Talkback says there's only one thing for it: stop immigration."," I've just moved into my first Auckland home. For what we've shelled out, we should be living in a mansion with an en suite dedicated to each bedroom, perched on the edge of a cliff enjoying expansive ocean views and spending our afternoons playing tennis in our backyard court."," The reality is a two-bedroom cottage with one tiny bathroom we can only reach by mounting a steep set of stairs. Sure, we can enjoy the afternoon sun in the backyard, but we'll be doing that on a patch of astroturf the size of a single car park."," When I feel particularly masochistic, I log on to property websites and gaze at the price the previous owners paid just three years ago. The house has nearly doubled in value. I've become the real life example of a terrible statistic."," Just this week, Demographia released its annual survey showing Auckland is now officially the fifth most-expensive place in the world to buy a house. Hence the call to close the borders. The trouble with believing this theory is that I've yet to bump into one of these uber-wealthy immigrants."," We bought our house at auction and there wasn't a single foreign bidder there. No accents, no Chinese money, just sound-like-they've-been-here-for-ages Kiwis."," Since moving in this week, I've scouted out my new neighbourhood. I don't see any of these property-magnate immigrants roaming the streets. The only folks I have met are Kiwis."," A study just out of the London School of Economics suggests that we are very, very wrong to blame immigrants for snapping up all the houses. For a start, the study says, immigrants often start out renting rather than buying."," That, I concede, poses its own raft of problems but not the one we're blaming them for."," The second point the study makes is one we should probably all have a long, hard think about. Apparently immigrants lower the value of properties."," It works like this: a foreign family moves into a house, the locally born neighbours start moving out one by one, no one really wants to buy there any more, the property prices fall.", I'm not sure I like what that says about us. Keeping out immigrants could well be one of the worst things we could do. These people are choosing to come to New Zealand because we're doing well. They're coming here because they want to do well., They're people with skills and money. They're the kind of people we want in this country., The track record for immigrants in this country is pretty good. Our beloved Lorde is the granddaughter of immigrants.," Grant Elliott, the man whose bat took us to our first Cricket World Cup Final, is an immigrant.", The Prime Minister is the son of an immigrant.," If you're looking for someone to blame, blame the banks that are once again handing out huge mortgages to people barely able to afford to buy.", Blame the Reserve Bank for keeping interest rates low so it can meet an increasingly arbitrary-seeming inflation target., Blame the council for making it hard to build new houses., Blame the Government for trying its darndest to avoid doing anything to make house prices drop., Just don't blame the immigrants., Debate on this article is now closed.

Beyond market leader bitcoin (BTC), the rating agency will also issue grades for ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), cardano (ADA), NEM (XEM), litecoin (LTC), stellar (XLM), EOS, IOTA, Dash, NEO, TRON, Monero (XMR), bitcoin gold (BTG) and many others.","The rating agency, which was founded in 1971, grades about 55,000 institutions and investments including banks, credit union, insurance companies, stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. Unlike Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch and A.M. Best, Weiss Ratings prides itself on never accepting compensation of any kind from the entities it rates.","The new cryptocurrency ratings are a first for any U.S. financial rating agency. They are said to be based on a model that analyzes thousands of data points on each coin’s technology, usage, and trading patterns. Besides enabling cautious investors to better assess the risks associated with an instrument they wish to invest in, ratings also define what trades many fund managers are allowed to take part in.","“Many cryptocurrencies are murky, overhyped and vulnerable to crashes. The market desperately needs the clarity that only robust, impartial ratings can provide,” said Weiss Ratings founder, Martin D. Weiss, PhD. “We’re proud to be the first to bring that benefit to investors — to help them cut through the hype and identify the few truly solid cryptocurrencies. Our ratings are based on hard data and objective analysis. But they’re bound to create controversy, including some grades that may come as a surprise to some people.”",Will this development help make bitcoin investments more mainstream on Wall Street?

"A white motorist called the police to report Dr. Dre of possessing a handgun. Sources close to the Black rapper revealed to TMZ that Dr. Dre was returning home on Monday when he noticed a car parked in his driveway, preventing his access to his home. The Black rapper and businessman told the driver to move away so he could drive into his house.

Nonetheless, it might have been a different story if it was an average Black person. It would have surely been a violent one. It is quite obvious that any call to the police to lodge a report against a Black man is always addressed with unnecessary aggression.

              ","Heading into the final months of the presidential primaries, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her team seem to be increasingly fed up with the Sanders campaign, which has remained competitive since the first votes were cast in Iowa, and continues to dog Clinton from the left. Early last week, Clinton’s chief strategist Joel Benenson remarked that if Sanders wanted another debate, he would have to “tone down” his “very negative” campaign, which — as I discussed in a previous article — is an absurd allegation, considering the Clinton camp has held a virtual monopoly on negative campaigning.","(True, there are some nasty and vulgar Sanders supporters on social media, who Sanders has condemned; but we are talking about the campaigns, not random users on the internet, and Clinton has plenty of unpleasant online enthusiasts as well.)","On Thursday, Clinton herself vented about the Sanders campaign at a rally in New York, and when confronted by a Greenpeace activist about her financial ties to the fossil fuel industry, she replied testily: “I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. I’m sick of it.”","Of course, no one is lying about Clinton, who employs a number of bundlers registered as lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry — as Greenpeace documents here — and in an issued response, Greenpeace Democracy Campaign Director Molly Dorozenski said the following:","“Secretary Clinton is conflating Greenpeace with the Sanders campaign, but we are an independent organization, and our research team has assessed the contributions to all Presidential candidates.  We have not and will not endorse candidates. Earlier this year, we asked both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders to sign our pledge to #fixdemocracy, and while Sanders signed, Clinton did not. We intend to continue to challenge all candidates to listen to the people, not their biggest donors.”","While the Clinton campaign is obviously ""sick"" of dealing with Sanders, and would love nothing more than to focus on Donald Trump and fundraising — without having to fret over criticisms about where the money is coming from — it is not so much Sanders, but the left, that has frustrated Clinton and Clinton supporters. When confronted by the Greenpeace activist, Clinton automatically assumed that she was a Sanders supporter with purely partisan intentions, not an environmentalist who is genuinely concerned about Clinton’s big money connections. Clinton and other Democratic centrists seem to have concluded that anyone who criticizes her from the left must simply be a Sanders hack.","Of course, the astonishing rise of Bernie Sanders has represented a revival for the American left, and the senator is the most prominent “democratic socialist” in American politics (even if he is himself a moderate on the political spectrum). For left-wingers, Sanders is indisputably preferable to Clinton, though he is no “purist,” as some liberals like to claim.","According to the British website, PoliticalCompass.org, which measures political ideology on a multi-axis model, based on social and economic beliefs, Sanders is the true moderate of the 2016 primaries, while Clinton is a both economically and socially on the center-right, and Republican candidates are on the far right. Sanders’ “economics are Keynesian or Galbraithian,” explains the website, “in common with mainstream parties of the left in the rest of the west  — the Labour or Social Democrat parties.”","Sanders is symbolic of a left-wing resurgence, and he has certainly made Clinton’s life harder with his impressive grassroots campaign. But the left has always been repelled by the Clintons, with or without Bernie. Ever since Bill and Hillary skyrocketed to political stardom in the early '90s and helped transform American liberalism, those on the left have regarded them both as unprincipled careerists who are willing to say just about anything to get elected. President Clinton’s administration frequently proved this to be the case, and there is little reason to think Hillary Clinton, who has shifted her rhetoric to the left during the primaries, won’t revert back to the center-right when all is said and done.","The difference between today and the '90s, however, is that the left is no longer in its last throes, as it was when the Clintons emerged as America’s most powerful couple. With the fall of communism and the global triumph of corporate capitalism, along with the Reagan/Thatcher counterrevolutions, the left — which had become disillusioned and divided (i.e. new left vs old left) — was in no shape to stand up to the tide of reaction. Moreover, when Reagan entered office, economic inequality was close to all time lows, after decades of New Deal liberalism. Today, after nearly 40 years of neoliberalism, economic inequality has returned to historic levels and American militarism has created a dangerously unstable world. Politics have changed with the times, and the American left, politically relevant again, is very much determined to prevent another Clinton administration.","Of course, this may not be possible; Clinton currently has a solid lead over Sanders, especially if you count her hold on pledged superdelegates. But Clinton shouldn’t assume that those on the left will simply fall in line if and when she becomes the nomination (though most left-wingers would probably agree that a neoliberal is better than a proto-fascist). Clinton may be sick of hearing about her Goldman Sachs speeches, but those on the left were sick of the Clintons twenty years ago, and will remain critical well beyond election year."," Conor Lynch is a writer and journalist living in New York City.

    The debate heated up between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as they questioned each other's personal record on several hot topics during the Democratic debate in Brooklyn, New York.
    VPC","Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders bellied up to the podiums for the ninth Democratic presidential debate Thursday, a milestone that seemed inconceivable when she launched her campaign a year ago as the overwhelming front-runner.",Here are a few takeaways from the DonnyBrooklyn:,"Bernie Sanders waves as he arrives on stage for the Democratic debate in Brooklyn. (Photo: Jewel Samad, AFP/Getty Images)","Sanders, pushed by Clinton to publicly release his tax returns, announced 1) that his wife Jane handles the taxes for the family and she has been really busy, and 2) he will release his most recent tax return Friday, and other years shortly thereafter. ""They are very boring tax returns,"" Sanders promised. ""No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate."" Clinton made no comparable news when pressed to release the transcripts of her privately paid speeches to Wall Street firms, repeating her defense that she will only release them when all the presidential candidates agree to release their private speeches.","Bill Clinton and President Obama at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York on Sept. 24, 2013. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)","Clinton made every effort to make sure that Sanders was debating not just her but her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and President Obama, her former boss. When Sanders attacked her for having a super PAC supporting her, she said ""this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama,"" because Obama also had a super PAC and yet did not kowtow to big donors. When Sanders said Clinton was soft on climate change, she pointed to her role in Obama's successes. ""I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the president has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported,"" she said. The former first lady said the crime bill her husband signed achieved some good things, despite concerns that it drove harsh sentences around the country, particularly for non-violent drug offenders. And when asked whether she would apologize for the excessive harshness of the law, she said, ""My husband has apologized. He was the president who actually signed it.""","Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are seen on television screens in the press room during a CNN-sponsored debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on April 14, 2016. (Photo: Justin Lane, European Pressphoto Agency)","Sanders has for a while now taken on Clinton over her 2002 Senate vote authorizing the Iraq War, which came up again Thursday night. But perhaps the most extended foreign policy exchange of the night was over their approaches to the long-simmering dispute between Israel and Palestine, long a key issue in New York. Sanders, who is Jewish, asserted that Israel unquestionably had a right to defend itself, but he argued for a much more balanced approach to dealing with the region, while reiterating his belief that Israel's operation in 2014 in Gaza was a ""disproportionate attack."" Clinton cited her past efforts in the region but was much more critical of Palestinians. Perhaps most noteworthy was Sanders' forceful critique of Clinton for not reaching out more to the Palestinians. ""You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians,"" he said.","""All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided,"" he said in concluding the exchange. ""There are two sides to the issue.""","Merrick Garland, President Obama's choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, arrives for a meeting on Capitol Hill on April 14, 2016. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)","The Senate Republican leadership has made clear since the day Justice Antonin Scalia died that an Obama nominee would not get a vote in 2016. Clinton and Sanders, not surprisingly, were united in their opposition to this approach. Clinton on Thursday night said ""the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history"" and challenged the Senate to act. Sanders called the situation ""an outrage."" However, when it came to the merits of Garland himself, things got a bit more complicated. When asked what she would do if she wins and the nomination is still pending, Clinton said, ""I will take stock of where we are and move from there."" Sanders was much more definitive. He said that, while he'd back the Garland nomination as a senator, if he is nominated and wins in November, ""I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination"" because Garland has not made ""crystal clear"" whether he would support overturning the Citizens United decision that led to the creation of super PACs.","Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton pass each other at the start of a break during the CNN debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on April 14, 2016. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP)","The New York primary is considered a critical contest for the Democratic nomination, but both candidates are heading for the airports. Sanders is flying to the Vatican for an academic conference on social and economic inequality; Clinton is heading to California for a round of campaign events and fundraisers. He apparently won't see the pope, but she apparently will see George Clooney. (Advantage: Clinton)"

","Cyanogen Inc. and Microsoft announced a ""strategic partnership"" today to bundle Microsoft services into the Cyanogen OS. The agreement includes ""Bing services, Skype, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, and Microsoft Office.""","Cyanogen started as an aftermarket Android ROM maker, but recently the group went pro, formed a company, and started taking VC funding. It got an outside CEO, Kirk McMaster, who has stated that the new company's (very ambitious) goal is to ""take Android away from Google."" Cyanogen wants to supply its Android distribution to OEMs as a kind of outsourced software house, and currently Cyanogen OS powers the OnePlus One. The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft was going to invest in Cyanogen, but the deal fell through at some point, apparently in favor of this partnership.","""People around the world use Cyanogen's operating system and popular Microsoft services to engage with what matters most to them on their mobile devices,"" said Cyanogen's CEO. ""This exciting partnership with Microsoft will enable us to bring new kinds of integrated services to mobile users in markets around the world.""","Further ReadingGoogle’s iron grip on Android: Controlling open source by any means necessaryIf Cyanogen really wants to ship a Googleless Android, it will need to provide alternatives to Google's services, and this Microsoft deal is a small start. Microsoft can provide alternatives for Search (Bing),  Google Drive (OneDrive and Office), and Gmail (Outlook). The real missing pieces are alternatives to Google Play, Google Maps, and Google Play Services. Cyanogen has said it will develop an app store in-house, but we haven't heard plans for a mapping client or media stores, though it could just leave that up to users and it wouldn't be a huge deal.","What is a big deal for any non-Google Android fork is Google Play Services. Many apps depend on it, and without it, Cyanogen won't be able to run apps that use Google's push notifications, in-app purchases, Ads, Google Cast, Google Play Games, location APIs, and a ton of other features. Amazon combats this on the Kindle line by offering drop-in replacement APIs for Google Play Services, and if Cyanogen wants a serious app ecosystem it will need to do the same.","Microsoft has been increasingly taking a ""horizontal"" approach to Android, seeing it as a platform it should expand to. The company brought Office over to Android tablets and will reportedly bring its voice assistant, Cortana, to Android as well. It also collects patent royalties from just about every major Android OEM, and the company signed a more limited distribution agreement with Samsung, which shipped OneNote and OneDrive on the Galaxy S6.","""We aspire to have our tools within arm's reach of everyone, to empower them in all aspects of their lives. This partnership represents another important step towards that ambition,"" said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of Microsoft Corp. ""We'll continue to deliver world-class experiences across productivity and communications on Windows, and we're delighted that Cyanogen users will soon be able to take advantage of those same powerful services.""",You must login or create an account to comment.,Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.,"

But Obama said the Ferguson case ""speaks to broader challenges that we still face as a nation.''",Prosecutor McCulloch made the announcement in an unusual nighttime presentation in a courtroom. He spoke at length about media coverage of the case and what he called the unreliability of eyewitness accounts. He said the grand jury weighed evidence and testimony before concluding there was no probable cause to indict the officer.,"""The duty of the grand jury is to separate fact from fiction,'' McCulloch said.","He said prosecuting attorneys presented five potential indictments to the grand jury, and all were rejected.","""The jury was not inclined to indict on any charges,'' Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said after being informed of the decision by authorities.","In grand jury testimony released by prosecutors Monday night, Wilson, the officer, described the confrontation and said that Brown refused his instructions to stop walking in the street. He said Brown cursed him, then slammed the officer's car door shut as he was trying to exit his vehicle.","He said Brown appeared to be trying ""almost like to intimidate or overpower me.'' They scuffled and Brown hit the officer, Wilson testified.","""When  I grabbed him, the only way I can describe it is I felt like a five-year-old holding Hulk Hogan,'' Wilson said.","He had no Taser weapon and felt his mace spray would not work, Wilson said: ""So the only other option I thought I had was my gun."" He drew it, he said, and told Brown to ""get back or I'm going to shoot you."" He said Brown grabbed the gun with his right hand and twisted it, pushing it down into Wilson's hip, before the officer fired.",Brown's family attorneys received a call from McCulloch shortly before the announcement that there would be no charges against the officer. Crump took the call and and delivered the news to Brown's family in an area hotel.,REACTION:  Legal and advocacy groups sound off,APOLOGY:  Peter King sorry for 'indictment' tweet,"Lesley McSpadden, Brown's mother, cried and shouted when Crump told her there was no  indictment and that the prosecutor was willilng  to meet with the family.",McSpadden began crying and shouting. Her body vibrated with pain as she jumped to her feet.,"""I do want to meet with him right now,"" McSpadden screamed. ""What do you mean no indictment?!""",She then ran out of a hotel room followed by family members.,"Brown's family later released a statement saying, ""We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions.'' They urged others who share their pain to ""channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change.''","Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, called for calm after calling up National Guard troops to stand by in case of unrest. Speaking before the decision was announced, he urged that ""regardless of the decision, people on all sides show tolerance, mutual respect and restraint.''","Crowds gathered around the Ferguson police headquarters in anticipation of the announcement at the courthouse in Clayton, Mo., another St. Louis suburb.","The 12-person grand jury had been considering whether probable cause existed to bring charges against Wilson, 28, the white officer who fatally shot Brown, an 18-year-old black man, after their Aug. 9 confrontation. The shooting inflamed tensions in a largely minority community that is patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force.","Brown's lifeless and bleeding body lay for more than four hours in a Ferguson residential street after the shooting, prompting dismay and anger as a crowd gathered. Protests turned into rioting and looting the following night, and police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas, triggering a nationwide debate over police tactics.","The grand jury, including nine whites and three African Americans, had been meeting in secret for months, hearing evidence and weighing whether Wilson's should face charges that could have ranged from involuntary manslaughter to murder.","Brown's family joined thousands of protesters to demand Wilson's arrest in the weeks after the death of their son. As anger at official inaction grew following Brown's death, protesters clashed with police, who began patrolling the streets with military-grade weapons and armored vehicles.",Wilson has been on paid leave and largely invisible since the shooting.,"While the grand jury met in secret to hear evidence in the case, two starkly different versions of the events leading to the shooting emerged in media accounts.","Police have said a scuffle broke out after Wilson asked Brown and a friend to move out of the street. Wilson told investigators he shot Brown only after the teenager reached for the officer's gun. Some witnesses said Brown had run away from Wilson, then turned and raised his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender before he was shot in the head and chest.","Paul Morris (center front) boards up his store in Ferguson on Nov. 24. (Photo: Nick Oza, USA TODAY)","The unusual timing of the grand jury's announcement, after darkness had fallen, was a decision of prosecutors, Nixon said.",,"St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay acknowledged the case ""has deeply divided us'' but said ""turning violent or damaging property will not be tolerated.''","""The world will be watching us,'' Slay said.","The death of Brown touched off weeks of protests, and the decision by the grand jury on whether to bring charges prompted extraordinary precautions by law enforcement and the community. The Ferguson school district canceled Tuesday classes.","Police officers secure an area in front of the Buzz Westfall Justice Center in Clayton, Mo. (Photo: Jewel Samad, AFP/Getty Images)",,What we know today about Ferguson,"Ferguson needs facts, not passions: Column",Timeline: Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson,A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. ,Wilson could still face civil rights charges brought by the Justice Department or a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by Brown's parents.,"Contributing: Brad Heath, Pete Eisler, USA TODAY;  KSDK-TV, St. Louis"

"I fell in love with Bitcoin in 2013, rode the wave from 100 up to 1000 USD then held and accumulated through the dark years that followed.","Bitcoin is the public crypto currency. We have been indoctrinated to believe in public wealth, transparency and disclosure. This goes hand in hand with reporting your income, paying your taxes and being a good citizen.","The transparency of Bitcoin is the best hope that the status quo has for maintaining its rent collection schemes. Soon 1099 disclosure forms from Coinbase will be just as routine as they are from Fidelity. And just as you would not buy your groceries with shares of Intel, you will not buy them with Bitcoin.",Why not? After all lightning network will make it cheap and easy to buy a pack of chewing gum with Bitcoin.,"Think about this from the perspective of the merchant. In order to transact directly in Bitcoin, they would be taking on a huge accounting burden and tax/audit risk. These transactions, to the extent that they exist, will ultimately be processed/blessed by the banking system which will collect rent for themselves and the government.","As much as government and corporations would like for you to believe that they are essential to maintain order, enforce contracts and keep you safe, their main vocation is shutting down the competition, collecting rent and printing new currency at your expense.","In the end, Bitcoin will be a magnet for public wealth, perhaps even national reserves.","On the other hand, a truly opaque, fungible crypto currency, of which Monero is the only example right now, will be a magnet for private wealth and private interactions. Monero will dramatically bring down the cost and risk of holding and transacting private wealth, while at the same time extending the reach of these private networks exponentially. Lightning network and other second layer solutions which are being developed with Bitcoin in mind, will pave the way for second layer scaling of private crypto currency networks.","In an age of local 3D printed products, local energy and food production, free online education and information distribution, these private networks are poised for explosive growth.","Investor, software geek. Only settle with a private, fungible blockchain."

            ",Powered by,"Update: Visa has corrected its vague statement with regards to the Coinbase technical issue which resulted in overcharging multiple cryptocurrency buyers. Previously, the company denied fault for the issue, practically shifting blame back to the popular exchange desk.","The company has now released another statement, together with payment processing service Worldpay, which suggests the issue might not have been Coinbase’s fault after all. Still, the statement conveniently refrains from naming the culprit for this massive blunder.","“Over the last two days, some customers who used a credit or debit card at Coinbase may have seen duplicate transactions posted to their cardholder account.”","“Worldpay and Coinbase have been working with Visa and Visa issuing banks to ensure that the duplicate transactions have been reversed and appropriate credits have been posted to cardholder accounts,” the statement continues. “All reversal transactions have now been issued, and should appear on customers’ credit card and debit card accounts within the next few days.”","“We believe the majority of these reversals have already posted to accounts,” it adds. “If you continue to have problems with your credit or debit card account after this reversal period, including issues relating to card fees or charges, we encourage you to contact your card issuing bank.”","While it is great to hear that customers will get refunds, it is quite disappointing to see that seemingly all companies involved have quietly gotten away without accepting responsibility for this mess.","Meanwhile, there is still no clear timeline on when customers can expect to receive their money back.","Following a technical issue which resulted in Coinbase overcharging numerous cryptocurrency buyers for up to 50 times their original purchase, VISA has now come out to blame the bug on the popular exchange desk.","“Visa has not made any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions cardholders are reporting,” a Visa spokesperson told TNW. “We are also not aware of any other merchants who are experiencing this issue.”","“We are reaching out to this merchant’s acquiring financial institution to offer assistance and to ensure cardholders are protected from unauthorized transactions,” the statement concluded.",This dreadful situation first started shaping up when tons of Coinbase users rushed to Reddit to complain that the cryptocurrency exchange desk has wrongly charged them multiple times for their original purchase – some buyers claim they’ve been charged for up to 50 times the intended purchase.,"Shortly after the news broke, Coinbase reached back to TNW to clarify that its team is investigating the issue, speculating it might have to do with recent changes to the MCC code by banks and financial institutions.","“This is related to the recent MCC code change by the card networks and card issuers charging additional fees,”  Coinbase told TNW. “We have identified a solution and future purchases will not be affected. We will ensure any customer affected by this issue is fully refunded. We expect these refunds to happen for customers automatically through their bank.”","Shortly after that, the company took to Twitter to shift the blame to Visa.","2/ Over the last few months, large banks and card issuers requested that card networks change the MCC for purchases of digital currency. Visa changed the MCC for digital currency purchases to a code that allows large banks and card issuers to charge consumers additional fees.","— Coinbase (@coinbase) February 16, 2018","4/ If you have been affected by any erroneous charges associated with purchases of digital currency with credit and debit cards, we are encouraging customers to contact their bank or card issuer and ask about the charges. In addition, please contact Coinbase support.","— Coinbase (@coinbase) February 16, 2018","Coinbase has since assured users that the accidental charges will be refunded. Unfortunately, the company was unable to provide TNW a clear timeline for the refunds.","“We’ll work with banks to ensure refunds are processed as soon as possible,” a Coinbase spokesperson told us over email. “In many cases we expect that many refunds should happen automatically.”","While Visa and Coinbase are fighting over who should take responsibility for this massive blunder, heaps of affected cryptocurrency investors have cried out that the accidental multiple charges have practically emptied out their bank accounts.","

6 Min Read,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s government said on Thursday it plans to ban cryptocurrency trading, sending bitcoin prices plummeting and throwing the virtual coin market into turmoil as the nation’s police and tax authorities raided local exchanges on alleged tax evasion. ","The clampdown in South Korea, a crucial source of global demand for cryptocurrency, came as policymakers around the world struggled to regulate an asset whose value has skyrocketed over the last year.   ",Justice minister Park Sang-ki said the government was preparing a bill to ban trading of the virtual currency on domestic exchanges. ,"“There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,” Park told a news conference, according to the ministry’s press office. ","After the market’s sharp reaction to the announcement, the nation’s Presidential office hours later said a ban on the country’s virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalised while it was one of the measures being considered. ","A press official at the justice ministry said the proposed ban on cryptocurrency trading was announced after “enough discussion” with other government agencies, including the nation’s finance ministry and financial regulators.  ","Once a bill is drafted, legislation for an outright ban of virtual coin trading will require a majority vote of the total 297 members of the National Assembly, a process that could take months or even years.  ",The government’s tough stance triggered a selloff of the cryptocurrency on both local and offshore exchanges.   ,"The local price of bitcoin plunged as much as 21 percent in midday trade to 18.3 million won ($17,064.53) after the minister’s comments. It still trades at around a 30 percent premium compared to other countries.  ","Bitcoin BTC=BTSP was down more than 10 percent on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp at $13,199, after earlier dropping as low as $13,120, its weakest since Jan. 2. ","South Korea’s cryptocurrency-related shares were also hammered. Vidente (121800.KQ) and Omnitel (057680.KQ), which are stakeholders of Bithumb, skidded by the daily trading limit of 30 percent each.  ","Once enforced, South Korea’s ban “will make trading difficult here, but not impossible,” said Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at EST Security. ","“Keen traders, especially hackers, will find it tough to cash out their gains from virtual coin investments in Korea but they can go overseas, for example Japan,” Mun said. ","Park Nok-sun, a cryptocurrency analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said the herd behavior in South Korea’s virtual coin market has raised concerns.  ","Indeed, bitcoin's BTC=BTSP 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked huge demand for cryptocurency in South Korea, drawing college students to housewives and sparking worries of a gambling addiction.  ","“Some officials are pushing for stronger and stronger regulations because they only see more (investors) jumping in, not out,” Park said. ","By Thursday afternoon, the Justice Ministry’s announcement had prompted more than 55,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to halt the crackdown on the virtual currency, making the Blue House website intermittently unavailable due to heavy traffic, the website showed. ","There are more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, according to Korea Blockchain Industry Association.  ","The proliferation of the virtual currency and the accompanying trading frenzy have raised eyebrows among regulators globally, though many central banks have refrained from supervising cryptocurrencies themselves. ",The news of South Korea’s proposed ban came as authorities tightened their grip on some cryptocurrency exchanges. ,The nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinone and Bithumb were raided by police and tax agencies this week for alleged tax evasion. The raids follow moves by the finance ministry to identify ways to tax the market that has become as big as the nation’s small-cap Kosdaq index in terms of daily trading volume.    ,Some investors appeared to have taken preemptive action.  ,"“I have already cashed most of mine (virtual coins) as I was aware that something was coming up in a couple of days,” said Eoh Kyung-hoon, a 23-year old investor.  ","Bitcoin sank on Monday after website CoinMarketCap removed prices from South Korean exchanges, because coins were trading at a premium of about 30 percent in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. That created confusion and triggered a broad selloff among investors. ","An official at Coinone told Reuters that a few officials from the National Tax Service raided the company’s office this week. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Coinone was cooperating with the investigation.  ","Bithumb, the second largest virtual currency operator in South Korea, was also raided by the tax authorities on Wednesday. ","“We were asked by the tax officials to disclose paperwork,” an official at Bithumb said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.  ",The nation’s tax office and police declined to confirm whether they raided the local exchanges.  ,"South Korean financial authorities had previously said they are inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions, amid concerns the increasing use of such assets could lead to a surge in crime.

Van Susteren had a ""key-man clause"" allowing her to exit if Ailes were to depart, Kurtz reported, and chose to activate it when contract renegotiation's became deadlocked. ",,

There’s an ongoing conversation about race and racism on social media — but white people are missing most of it. ,"A Pew Research Center report released Monday asked Americans who identified as black, white, and Hispanic about how much they post about race, and how much content they see about it.","Pew studied “social media users” (those who answered “yes” to the question, “Do you ever use a social networking site like Facebook or Twitter?”) and found that, overall, only four in 10 people surveyed said “at least a few” of the posts they personally share are about race or “race relations.” Sixty percent said none of their social media postings ever touch the subject. ","That seems unsurprising. After all, for many, race is a topic that is too sensitive and controversial to discuss publicly. Some people would rather not know what their online “friends” think. Others likely want to avoid a confrontation in the comments, and go silent on this topic as well as on things like politics and religion that could bring out clashing opinions.","But according to this new report, the degree of a user’s avoidance is itself related to his or her race. ",Not everyone is choosing animal videos and vacation pictures over commentary about race and racism. Pew found that black social media users are more likely than white or Hispanic users to use social media to discuss race. Twenty-eight percent of black social media users say at least some of the things they share or post on social networking sites are about race or race relations. One in five Hispanic respondents say the same. ,"Meanwhile, only 8 percent of white social media users say that at least some of things they share or post are about race relations, with a large majority (67 percent) saying they don’t venture into this area. ","And it looks like black social media users who opt out of sharing their own race-related posts are still much more likely to see this content in their feed than their white counterparts. “Even among black social media users who say they rarely or never discuss race relations or racial inequality, a majority (55 percent) state that most or some of the posts they see on social media pertain to race or race relations. That share drops to 23 percent for their white counterparts,” according to Pew. ","That means many white users are missing out on the important debates, analysis, and awareness-raising content that Pew found, in another part of the study, is often responsive to breaking news about racial injustice and draws attention to concerns about things like diversity and representation. For example, the researchers found that six in 10 race-related tweets were tied to current events, and that Twitter’s most active days for discussing race were inspired by topics like a white supremacist’s attack on a Charleston church, deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police, and related demonstrations.  ","""White people think race is something outside themselves, and they don't consider themselves a race,"" Whitney Dow, the 53-year-old filmmaker behind the Whiteness Project, an interactive investigation designed to explore how Americans who identify as white think about and experience their ethnicity, said in an interview with Vox last year. ","There are some signs that that idea — that white people have an identity worth thinking about, and a natural stake in tackling racism — is beginning to take hold.","In MTV's 2015 documentary White People, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas traveled the country to interview a cross section of young white Americans: teachers at a predominantly Native American elementary school, a kid from an all-white town who attends a historically black college, a recent high school graduate who frets that she's missed out on scholarships because of her race, and the leader of a workshop on white privilege. Their narratives were supplemented by interviews with experts, plus statistics and charts about demographics and attitudes that flash across the screen.","The point? ""We cannot have an honest and real conversation about race in America if we can't talk about what being white means in America,"" Vargas told the LA Times in a pre-premiere interview.","Then there are lower-profile examples of white Americans’ efforts to invest in conversations about race. Meetup.com's Boston Knapsack Anti-Racism Group, which I wrote about last year, is just one of the many groups around the country that includes white people who are committed to racial justice.",Many of its members likely share an outlook with white demonstrators seen holding “White silence = violence” signs at many recent protests against racialized police violence.,"Meanwhile, in an effort to reach the next generation, New York City's private Fieldston Lower School implemented a program in 2015 that splits up kids, starting in third grade, into racial ""affinity groups,"" where they are encouraged to have frank conversations about their identities and experiences, and then reunite for a curriculum designed to ""foster interracial empathy.""","What makes the program unique is that it isn't just for the black, Latino, and Asian students. White students have their own group, too — and participation is mandatory. Mariama Richards, the school administrator behind the program, told New York magazine's Lisa Miller that when other schools have affinity groups, ""they send the white kids to recess."" But true integration, she said, ""doesn't happen if only half the people are talking about it.”","""What I am suggesting is that we all have skin in the game. I'm suggesting that we all need to be involved in this conversation,"" Richards said.",That’s hard to argue with. And social media seems like an easy place to start. ,"The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox."
The subject of Kava Gorna‘s photography book 100 Cheeks is exactly what the title suggests: butts.  ,Gorna originally began taking the photos as a celebration of denim.  ,"“I often shoot for fashion and art, and these were shots that I was taking on the side,” Gorna tells PEOPLE. “I was always interested in how women interpret what is technically a uniform – a standard jean – in a way where you can see different bodies and different styles. Once I realized that I was developing a collection of these images, I decided it would be great to share it with the world.”  ","Although she didn’t set out to photograph just butts, they soon became a natural focus of her pictures.  ","“It just became a constant that I could photograph that represented my fixation on denim and my admiration of female sexuality,” says Gorna.  ",The New York City-based photographer includes women of all shapes and sizes in her book (available online and in Urban Outfitters stores).  ,"“You have a feeling that everyone is perfect, because they are in my eyes,” she says. “I love the idea of inspiring women to be confident about themselves, to feel that they can be sexy.”","If you have opted in for our browser push notifications, and you would like to

"Over two hundred years  black people were enslaved and humiliated by Whites who now pretend as if slavery and racism never existed. Basically, the situation has hardly changed at all and white supremacy still targets black people. With the 13th Amendment, which officially abolished slavery in the U.S., racial profiling found its way in an educational, health care system and many others where Whites can show their hatred of Blacks.","The Confederate flag is a bright example perfectly saying that Whites are proud of that shameful period they created in history. Being a deeply painful symbol of white supremacy, the flag makes the African-American descendants of slaves feel offended and hurt.","This legacy of racism enduring to this day needs to be banned. While white racists continue to believe that Blacks are inferior to them, activists like John Sims launch a large-scale fight against injustice. Thus, he attempted to turn Memorial Day into Confederate flag-burning day. Sims organized 13 flag-burning events across the 13 states of the Confederacy saying that “the Confederate flag is the N-word on a pole.”","We are here to remind that Black people remember everything and they won’t let it go. The deliberate displaying of confederate symbols is exactly what must be considered a hate crime. Until the authorities understand it, we won’t move on.","We cannot absolve Whites of their racial sins. They have to work hard to prove they regret. We recommend starting with paying reparations to the descendants of those who were so unfairly treated. Unfortunately, there’s little hope that the US government will recognize its mistakes.",Kindly share this article on any social network and help prevent racism in America. Comments and opinions are also welcomed., ,"The exact amount in federal funding comes to $97,999.70, according to the official award notice that was posted on the Washington Free Beacon."
"The minimum wage peaked in 1968 at $8.54 per hour, after adjusting for inflation. The current $7.25 is far too low for the 3 million hourly workers who earn at or below that threshold, and certainly not at par with the wage hikes instituted by other countries with similar economic trajectories.",Here’s The Economist on America’s embarrassingly low minimum wage: ,"Given the pattern across the rest of the OECD, a group of mostly rich countries, one would expect America, where GDP per person is $53,000, to pay a minimum wage around $12 an hour. That would mean a raise of about 65% for Americans earning the minimum pay rate. ","But while several states have higher local minimums (and some cities plan to raise them further), the U.S. as a whole is not where it needs to be. To visualize the problem, MIT has released a new tool called the Living Wage Calculator, which maps the difference between minimum wage and basic costs of living in cities and counties across America. The map shows that for most minimum wage earners, supporting their families is an enormous struggle.","To work the tool, you can choose three types of households: a parent with a spouse and two children, a single parent with one child, or a single adult. Once selected, the tool maps the difference between living wage (the cost of living required to get by) and minimum wage for this household. The darker red the county or city, the greater the difference.",Here’s the county map for households with one parent supporting a non-working spouse and two-children:,"The entire map is fiery red; there isn’t a single county in which a minimum wage can match the local cost of living. In some counties, such as Marin County near San Francisco or Prince Williams County in Virginia, the breadwinner of this household would have to bring in upwards of $20 more per hour to support his or her family.","Things are tough for a single parent with one child, too. The living wage is higher than the minimum wage in every state. Not surprisingly, cities such as New York, Boston, Washington and Chicago—where housing and other expenses are sky-high—are stained the deepest red:","For single adults, the map shows that Washington State, where the minimum wage is $9.32, is a sort of living-wage oasis. It contains patches (in green) where the cost of living is actually lower than the minimum wage. Adults making the minimum in Pend Oreille County, for instance, bring in 65 cents more an hour than they need to get by.","The city map for single adults, however, shows that urban living is still far too expensive for low-wage workers, even if you don’t have dependents to support:",Play around with the maps here.,"Tanvi Misra is a staff writer for CityLab covering immigrant communities, housing, economic inequality, and culture.

 The Prime Minister is launching into 2016 with plans to stand for an historic fourth term.," In a wide-ranging interview with the Weekend Herald about the year ahead, John Key confirmed his intention to fight another election and remain in office. ""My stock standard position has been that I intend to stay for as long as I think I can add value and the party wants me,"" he said."," ""That's my position. It's not something where I've gone away and actively considered but that is my position at the moment."""," He is back at work after spending Christmas with family in his holiday home on Maui, Hawaii, followed by a road-trip with his wife, Bronagh, from Los Angeles to San Francisco.", Tomorrow afternoon he will be welcomed on to the marae at Ratana with other politicians.," And on Tuesday, after Wellington Anniversary Day on Monday, he will chair the first Cabinet of the year - although it will be without Finance Minister Bill English and Transport Minister Simon Bridges who will be visiting the Antarctic."," Mr Key said this year would be an important one for the Government because in reality, it was a lot harder to get things done next year.", He believed people cemented their voting intentions a lot earlier than many commentators thought.," ""I'm not saying campaigns don't matter at the margins - they certainly can and do change voting patterns within the margins and within different blocs. But if swinging voters see a strong performance this year, they are much more likely to vote for us next year."""," He said he wanted this year to be similar to other years in which he tried to deliver results ""to keep earning the right to be there""."," He implied there was disconnection between National's high poll rating (51.3 per cent in the December DigiPoll survey) and what he called ""the noise"" in the media about the Government's performance."," ""The things that people really look to the Government for, economic performance, health, education, law and order, the Government has been delivering improving results to people.""",,SHARE THIS QUOTE:," Asked how he was going to lift living standards for New Zealanders he said: ""In the same way we have in the past. In the main areas that count for people: interest rates, inflation, and real growth, you've got to have them occurring in a positive way.""", Auckland was a market dominated by people with larger mortgages because of high house prices.," ""For those people and for that group of voters, the two things that are really critical are interest rates staying low and the job market staying strong. So if they lose their job there is opportunity and that their mortgages don't climb despite the nominal size of their mortgage.""", Auckland housing would continue to be a big focus of attention this year to avoid a housing bubble and to help first-home buyers get on to the ladder.," ""But I don't think there is ever going to be one single thing you can do.""", Everything the Government had done had generally been working.," ""I suspect you'll see increases in house prices this year but at a much lower rate than we saw in 2015."""," John Key says he won't change his approach to commercial radio despite being lured into a cage in a studio where he became part of a ""gag"" about male rape in prisons."," He left for a Christmas holiday in Hawaii and California without commenting on publicity around the antics but, in his first interview of the new year, he told the Weekend Herald there were always risks with commercial radio."," ""If I really want to eliminate all those risks, I'd have to stop going on them,"" he said. ""I'm not going to stop going on commercial radio stations because, in the end, that has been an important way for me to communicate with a broad audience, some of whom are only very tangentially interested in politics."""," He said he had had no idea what The Rock had in store for him when he was asked to join Tom Furniss in a cage in the studio, other than the host was going to get ""100 likes"" on Facebook if he joined him."," Once he was inside, Furniss asked him to pick up a bar of soap, which he did, not knowing it was a reference to prison rape."," He said he had not known what the context was around the reference. And in fact when the host dropped the soap, he had said it had been in the toilet."," ""That's what I thought the joke was. I can't stop these guys from doing some slightly crazy stuff."," ""All I could do is not go on any of those shows but there are an awful lot of commercial radio stations and I'm on a hell of a lot of them during the course of the year."""

","The confirmation comes a fortnight after the Chilean government announced that the signing would go ahead in New Zealand on 4 February - news the New Zealand government refused to confirm last week, saying the arrangements had not been decided on.","Trade Minister Todd McClay said the signing on 4 February will mark the end of the TPP negotiating process, after which all 12 countries will have up to two years to ratify the agreement before it enters into force.","

","Following the signing, the government will submit the final text of the TPP and the National Interest Analysis to Parliament.","Mr McClay said during the period before the agreement enters into force, the government would be running a series of roadshows throughout the country.",The 12-nation TPP trade deal was concluded in October after five years of negotiations and a marathon final session of talks in the United States.,"Under the agreement, New Zealand joins a club that accounts for 40 percent of the world economy.","The TPP will eliminate tariffs on 93 percent of New Zealand's exports to the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Peru. The government estimates the agreement will be worth at least $2.7 billion a year by 2030 for New Zealand.","For the dairy industry there were gains such as the removal of tariffs on some cheeses and infant formula in the United States within 10 years, but whole milk powder improvements remained elusive. Canada offered only limited new access, with just an extra 3.25 percent for dairy on top of the country's annual production.","TPP opponents have criticised secrecy around the deal, and remain convinced there will be changes to the Pharmac model though the government has said that will not be the case.","The Sustainability Council says the environment will suffer under the final text of the TPP, which it says it failed to protect the government from being sued by foreign investors if they believed that their future profits were at stake.","There were provisions that protected governments from being sued for acting to reduce smoking but no similar protections for acting to protect the environment or tackle climate change, the council said.",Confirmation of the signing comes as research on the trade deal by senior law lecturers argues it fails to meet obligations to Maori and conflicts with the Treaty of Waitangi.,Report co-author Carwyn Jones of Victoria University said there was a treaty exception in the deal but it was open to interpretation and relied on the government's good will.,He said Maori already have difficulty engaging with the government on matters like the environment and intellectual property and the TPP will only make that worse.,"""You're introducing these other parties who don't have any Treaty of Waitangi obligations, don't have any concerns about the New Zealand government fulfilling its Treaty of Waitangi obligations and so make it all that much less likely that the government will be willing to try to reform in a way that recognises Maori rights.""",However Trade Minister Todd McClay said nothing in the TPP would prevent the Crown meeting its obligations to Maori.,The Waitangi Tribunal will hold an urgent hearing in March to discuss the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,"The TPP will be signed two days before Waitangi Day, and former Te Tai Tokerau MP Hone Harawira has warned Prime Minister John Key may face a tempestuous situation at commemoration.",Ngapuhi elder Kingi Taurua had suggested the gates of Te Tii Marae should be closed if the government had signed the trade deal before 6 February.,"Mr Harawira said the TPP was an attack on Maori and the rights of all New Zealanders, and would be heavily discussed by groups coming from all around the country to Waitangi.","""And I think that when the prime minister arrives on the 5th when he's due to arrive, that it's certainly going to be raised there.","""It's going to be quite a tempestuous situation, I'd say.""","Copyright © 2016, Radio New Zealand","The environment will suffer under the final text of the Trans Pacific Partnership, according to the Sustainability Council.",The Public Health Association is criticising the government's support for the signing of the Trans Pacific Partnership.,"After five years of negotiations and a marathon final session of talks, agreement has been reached on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.","When New Zealand began negotiating a free trade deal with Singapore and Chile in 2002, it had a much more ambitious goal that has finally paid off, writes Brent Edwards.",for ad-free news and current affairs,Politics RSS,Follow RNZ News

",The Palestinian death toll in the conflict between Hamas and Israel reached 548 on Monday as officials said four were killed when a Gaza hospital was hit by Israeli fire.,"It followed the bloodiest day of the conflict so far on Sunday when at least 120 Palestinians were killed in Shujai'iya, a third of them women and children. Thirteen Israeli soldiers were also killed – two of them US citizens – in the heaviest loss of life for the Israeli military in years.","Staff at the al-Asqa Martyrs hospital were said to be in shock that the building was hit. ""People can't believe this is happening – that a medical hospital was shelled without the briefest warning. It was already full with patients,"" said Fikr Shalltoot, director of programmes at Medical Aid for Palestinians in Gaza city.","""Five people, I gather, were killed, and 15 were injured, including medical staff. I know the staff very well. My nephew is a medical doctor there.""","The US president, Barack Obama, has called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.","Israel continued its action on the Gaza City neighbourhood of Shujai'iya on Monday, where bombardment and fierce fighting on the ground the day before had left shattered streets littered with bodies.","Mounting international pressure for a ceasefire came amid continuing violence in Gaza. Overnight, Israeli strikes hit Gaza city, and the south and centre of the coastal enclave, home to 1.8 million people.","Twenty-five members of the same family were reported killed in an air strike in the south of Gaza, and a further 10 people were killed near Khan Younis.","In the West Bank, Palestinians began three days of mourning for the dead in Gaza. A general strike was under way on Monday.","The Israel Defence Forces said it had foiled attempts by Hamas fighters to infiltrate Israel through two tunnels from Gaza on Monday. Ten militants were killed in air strikes. The IDF also suffered casualties, Israel Radio reported."," Meanwhile, army spokesman Peter Lerner said the IDF could not rule out the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier by Hamas, despite denials late on Sunday by the Israeli ambassador to the UN, Ron Prosor. Investigations were continuing, the IDF said.","By Monday morning, 43 access points to 16 different tunnels had been discovered by Israeli troops on the ground. Military sources said the “sophisticated network of tunnels” within Gaza and under the border to Israel was much more extensive that originally thought.","The conflict is rapidly threatening to turn into a major humanitarian crisis hitting electricity and water supplies and seeing large numbers driven from their homes. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has opened 60 of its schools to shelter more than 83,000 people who have fled so far.",Obama's appeal came as the United Nations security council opened urgent talks on efforts to strike a ceasefire deal as Israel ramped up a major military offensive with fresh strikes on Monday in the Palestinian territory.,"""The members of the security council expressed serious concern about the growing number of casualties. The members of the security council called for an immediate cessation of hostilities,"" Rwandan UN ambassador Eugene Gasana told reporters after an emergency meeting of the 15-member council.","Amid signs of mounting pressure on both sides to end the conflict, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who is in the Middle East in an attempt to help broker a ceasefire, condemned the Israeli assault in Shuji'iya as an ""atrocious action"".","The call of a halt to the fighting came as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, was due to fly to Cairo on Monday for meetings with senior officials from Egypt and other countries, as diplomatic efforts to end the two-week long conflict appeared to be gaining some momentum.",The state department said Kerry would leave early on Monday for Egypt where he will join diplomatic efforts to resume a truce that had been agreed to in November 2012.,"In a statement on Sunday evening, department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the US and its international partners were ""deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation, and the loss of more innocent life"".",Ceasefire discussions between Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal and the Palestinian president were due to take place on Monday after being delayed by a day.,"UN chief Ban was also in Doha where he urged Israel to ""exercise maximum restraint"".","""Too many innocent people are dying … [and] living in constant fear,"" he told a news conference in Doha.","Speaking to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, by telephone early on Monday, Obama expressed his concern over the deaths on both sides, the White House said in a statement.","In their second call in three days, Obama ""reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself"" and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.","David Cameron also spoke to Netanyahu, reiterating ""the UK's strong support for Israel's right to take proportionate action to defend itself from"" Gaza rockets, while expressing condolences over the Israeli deaths and concern over the ""mounting civilian casualties in Gaza"".","Cameron agreed with Netanyahu that the way out of the ""spiral of violence"" was through the Egyptian ceasefire initiative, a spokesman for the British PM said.","So far, truce efforts have been rejected by Hamas, which has pressed on with its own attacks, undaunted by the Israeli bombardment by land, sea and air.","The Doctors Without Borders charity urged Israel to ""stop bombing civilians trapped in the Gaza Strip"", noting the majority of the injured arriving in the Al-Shifa hospital were women and children.","""While the official line is that the ground offensive is aimed at destroying tunnels, what we see on the ground is that bombing is indiscriminate and that those who are dying are civilians,"" the French NGO said in a statement."

She did this for two minutes until he stopped crying.," She put Milton back in his pepi pod (a bassinet-like sleeping cradle), but he continued crying and she became more angry."," So she picked him up and shook him again, while yelling at him to ""shut up"" and ""stop f...ing crying"". When he stopped crying, she put him back in the pepi pod and went outside for a cigarette."," When she returned inside, Milton began crying again so she picked him up again and shook him until he stopped crying."," This time, he remained silent for three hours. When he woke up, Paea tried to give him milk, but he was not swallowing and was pushing it out. So she put him beside her on a mattress while she watched television.","  At 6am the next morning, her partner woke up to find Milton gurgling. He picked him up, realised he wasn't breathing, and began CPR. When Milton failed to start breathing, he put him in his car seat, ran next door and asked neighbours to take them to hospital.", He then woke Paea and they all went to hospital.," Milton died at 10.38am. Hospital staff noted bruising to his face. He had head injuries, and an autopsy found these had caused his death."," Paea told police she had become ""stressed out and frustrated"" at Milton's crying, and had not been able to control herself."," Paea, now 19, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the High Court at Gisborne on Thursday, and was jailed for two years.","  Justice Geoffrey Venning said the circumstances of the case were ""truly tragic"", and any sentence must reflect what was a very serious crime."," ""Children are defenceless and properly have to look to their parents and caregivers for safety."," ""The consequences of shaking and striking babies is well known ... Regrettably, in New Zealand, such offending and the tragic outcome of it is all too common."," ""Young and defenceless infants or children are killed by young and inadequate parents who do not have sufficient skills or maturity to enable them to cope with the responsibilities and demands of parenthood."""," This was despite there being resources and support available in such cases, the judge said.", He noted that Paea had a personality disorder triggered by severe abuse when she was a child.," He also noted her early guilty plea, her immaturity, her sorrow and regret for Milton's death, and the fact that it appeared to be a one-off incident."," He said a sentence of home detention would not reflect society's concern for such offending, or act as a sufficient deterrent.",Stuff,© 2018 Stuff Limited

												",It’s clear now the FBI conducted a sweetheart investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email shenanigans that appears to have been fixed from the start to go nowhere.,"Far from exonerating Clinton, the nearly 60 pages of documents expose both the systematic destruction of subpoenaed evidence by Clinton’s aides and the curious lack of interest by investigators in recovering it.","Agents also failed to resolve unanswered questions, reconcile contradictory testimony or sweat uncooperative witnesses.",Comey declared the investigation free of undue influence three days after his agents interviewed Clinton at FBI headquarters under special terms.,"What’s more, Comey made the two FBI agents who interviewed Clinton — along with all agents and forensic analysts involved in the so-called investigation — sign non-disclosure agreements gagging them from talking about the case even with other employees.","Comey even let Clinton’s State Department aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson sit in on the interview with Clinton’s other lawyers, despite the glaring conflict of interest. FBI documents make clear Mills and Samuelson led the effort to search for and destroy Clinton’s subpoenaed emails and should’ve been prime targets of the investigation.","Comey didn’t even attend her interview and, per his testimony, only read a “summary” of it.","The FBI failed to pursue even the most basic lines of questioning. When Clinton pleaded ignorance about basic classification symbols, agents could’ve produced the State documents she signed acknowledging she was briefed about how to ID and handle classified information at the highest levels.","When Clinton claimed she couldn’t recall “ever contacting” the government computer specialist who set up her unsecured home email server, Comey could’ve produced the same evidence the State inspector general found showing Clinton had in fact paid the aide, Bryan Pagliano, “by check or wire transfer in varying amounts between 2009 and 2013.”","Pagliano was a critical witness. But instead of pressuring him to sing on Clinton and other higher-ups, Comey agreed to give him immunity from criminal prosecution.",Nor did Comey squeeze the Platte River Networks engineer who agents complained gave them “inconsistent statements over the course of three interviews regarding from where on the server he extracted Clinton’s emails.”,"Comey also failed to push back against Mills’ claims of “attorney-client privilege” when she refused to divulge details about how she sifted through Clinton’s emails. Her name was on many of the emails containing classified information. At the time, she was Clinton’s chief of staff, not her lawyer. Agents agreed to drop the line of questioning when she threatened to walk out of the interview.","Ron Sievert, a former assistant director at the Justice Department and member of the DOJ’s National Security Working Group, said Comey easily could’ve gone to court to challenge Mills’ privilege claim. He didn’t.","There was also prima facie evidence of obstruction, yet Comey let that slide, too.","FBI investigators were denied two out of five Clinton iPads, 13 of her mobile devices (some of which were smashed with hammers) and even an Apple laptop and a thumb drive containing a 2013 archive of Clinton’s emails that aides claimed got “lost” in the mail. The FBI accepted the story without even determining if the laptop was sent by UPS or USPS.",It’s plain Comey never planned to recommend charges. He didn’t even impanel a federal grand jury to hear the evidence investigators had gathered.,"What’s more, Comey and his investigators came across emails that showed signs of a possible pay-for-play scheme between Clinton Foundation donors and the State Department. Yet Comey chose not to expand the email investigation into a probe of public corruption.","“There seems universal agreement among those of us who know the law that no regular US government employee could get away with this,” Sievert said.","Unless Congress forces more public transparency on this Nixonian coverup — demanding the release of not just the FBI case summaries in full, without redactions, but also the supporting documents and transcripts of statements from key witnesses, along with the computer forensics reports — Clinton could waltz into the White House with Mills as her general counsel, where they’ll have the power of executive privilege to cover up even worse scandals.",Paul Sperry is the author of “INFILTRATION: How Muslim Spies and Subversives Have Penetrated Washington.”,"

Its hard enough getting a toddler to eat everything you'd like them to, in order to prevent any deficiencies, let alone to do it on a system that involves even more restrictions such as no animal products.

Cows need to be inseminated to become pregnant before they start giving milk for example. In industrial farming, the calves get taken away as soon as possible from the mother, the mother gets milked until she stops and the process repeats... until the mother cow is too old to yield enough, then she is 'retired' (not in a good way). Most laying hens live in a cage, where they can hardly walk, and they just eat and lay eggs. So, in theory, milk from a single cow of a small farm where her calve also gets to drink the milk is pretty ok. But in reality that's not what's happening behind the scenes.

I can adapt to almost anything for the right person.",Life is complicated enough without a strict diet,I’m a picky eater. I’d probably starve to death because it would be difficult to sustain myself on raw vegetables alone which is my preferred way to eat most vegetables. I already lack in iron despite eating red meat and dark chocolate regularly (dark chocolate contains iron). I don’t think I’d be a healthy vegan. I also actually enjoy meat aside from that.,Veganism is immoral.,46 more replies

            ",Powered by,"Update: Visa has corrected its vague statement with regards to the Coinbase technical issue which resulted in overcharging multiple cryptocurrency buyers. Previously, the company denied fault for the issue, practically shifting blame back to the popular exchange desk.","The company has now released another statement, together with payment processing service Worldpay, which suggests the issue might not have been Coinbase’s fault after all. Still, the statement conveniently refrains from naming the culprit for this massive blunder.","“Over the last two days, some customers who used a credit or debit card at Coinbase may have seen duplicate transactions posted to their cardholder account.”","“Worldpay and Coinbase have been working with Visa and Visa issuing banks to ensure that the duplicate transactions have been reversed and appropriate credits have been posted to cardholder accounts,” the statement continues. “All reversal transactions have now been issued, and should appear on customers’ credit card and debit card accounts within the next few days.”","“We believe the majority of these reversals have already posted to accounts,” it adds. “If you continue to have problems with your credit or debit card account after this reversal period, including issues relating to card fees or charges, we encourage you to contact your card issuing bank.”","While it is great to hear that customers will get refunds, it is quite disappointing to see that seemingly all companies involved have quietly gotten away without accepting responsibility for this mess.","Meanwhile, there is still no clear timeline on when customers can expect to receive their money back.","Following a technical issue which resulted in Coinbase overcharging numerous cryptocurrency buyers for up to 50 times their original purchase, VISA has now come out to blame the bug on the popular exchange desk.","“Visa has not made any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions cardholders are reporting,” a Visa spokesperson told TNW. “We are also not aware of any other merchants who are experiencing this issue.”","“We are reaching out to this merchant’s acquiring financial institution to offer assistance and to ensure cardholders are protected from unauthorized transactions,” the statement concluded.",This dreadful situation first started shaping up when tons of Coinbase users rushed to Reddit to complain that the cryptocurrency exchange desk has wrongly charged them multiple times for their original purchase – some buyers claim they’ve been charged for up to 50 times the intended purchase.,"Shortly after the news broke, Coinbase reached back to TNW to clarify that its team is investigating the issue, speculating it might have to do with recent changes to the MCC code by banks and financial institutions.","“This is related to the recent MCC code change by the card networks and card issuers charging additional fees,”  Coinbase told TNW. “We have identified a solution and future purchases will not be affected. We will ensure any customer affected by this issue is fully refunded. We expect these refunds to happen for customers automatically through their bank.”","Shortly after that, the company took to Twitter to shift the blame to Visa.","2/ Over the last few months, large banks and card issuers requested that card networks change the MCC for purchases of digital currency. Visa changed the MCC for digital currency purchases to a code that allows large banks and card issuers to charge consumers additional fees.","— Coinbase (@coinbase) February 16, 2018","4/ If you have been affected by any erroneous charges associated with purchases of digital currency with credit and debit cards, we are encouraging customers to contact their bank or card issuer and ask about the charges. In addition, please contact Coinbase support.","— Coinbase (@coinbase) February 16, 2018","Coinbase has since assured users that the accidental charges will be refunded. Unfortunately, the company was unable to provide TNW a clear timeline for the refunds.","“We’ll work with banks to ensure refunds are processed as soon as possible,” a Coinbase spokesperson told us over email. “In many cases we expect that many refunds should happen automatically.”","While Visa and Coinbase are fighting over who should take responsibility for this massive blunder, heaps of affected cryptocurrency investors have cried out that the accidental multiple charges have practically emptied out their bank accounts.","

,"ROME — On the eve of a trip to the United States, Pope Francis has called himself a “son of immigrants” and confirmed the point by issuing a blunt warning to any religious orders in Europe that spurn his recent call to open their doors to refugees because they want to make money off their properties instead.","Go ahead, the pope said, but be ready to pay taxes just like everybody else.","“Some religious orders say ‘No, now that the convent is empty we are going to make a hotel and we can have guests, and support ourselves that way, or make money,’” the pontiff said.","“Well, if that is what you want to do, then pay taxes! A religious school is tax-exempt because it is religious, but if it is functioning as a hotel, then it should pay taxes just like its neighbor. Otherwise it is not fair business.”","Renting space to help with operating expenses is a common practice among religious orders in Europe. For example, in Rome, a pensione operated by an order of nuns just outside St. Peter’s Square offers a room, breakfast, and Mass at 7 a.m. each day for $90 a night. They also rent their rooftop to CBS during major papal events.","The pope also announced that the two refugee families he plans to take in at the Vatican have been identified, and that they will remain “as long as the Lord wants.”",His comments came in an interview with veteran Catholic journalist Aura Miguel of Portugal’s Radio Renascença.,"In the interview, Francis once again blasted what he called “a bad and unjust socioeconomic system” in the early 21st century that he faults for Europe’s current refugee crisis.","The International Organization for Migration estimates that more than 350,000 migrants arrived at the European Union’s borders between January and August this year. Some believe those estimates are low: According to Eurostat, 662,000 people applied for asylum in the EU in 2014.","“Nowadays the world is at war against itself … in installments, bit by bit, but it is also at war against the land, because it is destroying the land, our common house, the environment,” the pontiff said, referring to the theme of his recent encyclical letter on ecology, “Laudato Si’.”","Francis also complained of corruption among public officials “at all levels,” saying he detects special frustration among a new generation of younger politicians.","“People are disappointed,” he said, “partly because of corruption, partly because of inefficiency.”","Reprising a familiar theme, Francis talked about his preference for a “bruised” Church to a “stale” one.","“If somebody has a room in his house which is closed for long periods, it develops humidity, and a bad smell. If a church, a parish, a diocese, or an institute lives closed in on itself, it grows ill and we are left with a scrawny Church, with strict rules, no creativity,” he said.","“On the contrary – if it goes forth – if a church and a parish go out into the world, then once outside they might suffer the same fate as anybody else who goes out: have an accident. Well in that case, between a sick and a bruised Church, I prefer the bruised, because at least it went into the street.”","With an eye to a synod on the family in October, Francis said it’s important to emphasize that Catholics whose marriages have broken down “are not excommunicated and should be integrated into Church life.”","“Drawing closer to the Mass, to catechesis, their children’s education, charity …. There are so many different options,” he said.","The pontiff also entertained a few personal questions, such as what keeps him up at night. The answer, it turns out, is nothing.",“The truth?” he said. “I sleep like a rock!”,"Francis departs Saturday for three days in Cuba, followed by a Sept. 22-27 swing through Washington, DC, New York, and Philadelphia.",An English translation of the full text of his interview with Radio Renascença can be found here.,"to keep delivering the best in smart, wired and independent Catholic news.","Knights of Columbus

He intentionally caused the US to lose the race to space to Russia in order to get the congressional funding he needed (congress freaked out and created NASA and actually gave it the money it needed).  He'd also be considered a far left liberal with similar economic positions as Bernie Sanders today (I call it common sense).  He got the Interstate highway system done, and oversaw and implemented the integration of the Armed Forces (though Truman started the process, Ike continued it and made it work).",Ike on the Military Industrial Complex:,http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/indust.html,FDR.,"His time in office was the harshest test for any President since the Civil War.  Great Depression.  Dust Bowl.  World War II.  Roosevelt not only led the nation through those things (though he died before the end of the war) but changed the nation in the process...for the better, IMO.","Prior to his Presidency, we were much more of an ""every man for himself"" country.  After, we were more ""we're all in this together.""  His ""fireside chats"" stand out as something unique in modern American Presidential history.  They were speeches (which all Presidents have done) but came across as much more personal than a typical address from the White House.","It was like the President was sitting in your living room, talking to you about his policies and plans in plain and simple language.","Calvin Coolidge. If you haven't heard of him, that's one of the main reasons he's such a good president.",John Tyler because why not,"Grover Cleveland, because he wasn't afraid to do what was unpopular but necessary.",Nixon.

See what you did, Destructoid?]",The official reveal of the next Call of Duty is imminent. We've seen a screenshot out of Game Informer and have a countdown set to go off Sunday morning. But let's not wait for that.,"Word has it via an untitled, ""leaked"" audio recording that actor Kevin Spacey will play a role in the Sledgehammer-developed title. Variety connected the dots using a visualizer on the audio file to come up with an image that looks like a man holding a weapon. His involvement has since been confirmed. And going off that VICE-produced video about private military companies released earlier today, we know the game's general theme.","Through a trusted source, Destructoid has learned the new Call of Duty, subtitled Advanced Warfare, revolves around a soldier of fortune group run by Spacey's character that has turned on the United States government.

"So many of you were rejoicing when BTC reached its ATH and sure, some greedy people got in and put in a lot of money and are possibly gone into debt to do that.",Now its around 50% down and those people must be shitting bricks. And what do you guys do? Get busy making fun of them and making us look like a bunch of assholes rather than a helpful gateway to this developing market.,"Right now, most people think we're just a bunch of kids that use cryptos to buy drugs. So with sentiments like this showing up, we look like immature dumbasses. We are setting the wrong example when other people browse through and what they see is that we're busy making fun of people losing money",I started participating when the Sub was a lot smaller and didn't see much of this before. So chances are it's a lot of you that are new here that are resorting to this behavior. So stop behaving like it's your baby and other newcomers are just suckers. Congratulate them on the investment and help them ride the tide. We're still in the early stages.,"I'm kindly asking to knock it off. Whether you like it or not, we're being watched and judged for shit like this.","EDIT: To those of you trying to educate me that this is normal shit in Crypto, yes I know that and I'm not freaking out here. What I'm saying is that for people who just got in the game and haven't seen this volatility before, it's gonna be hell. It's a big drop at 50%. Those kinds of numbers during 2008 made people kill themselves. I'm not trying to be the thought police here, I believe in freedom of speech...I'm just asking to be more considerate in what's posted on here, use your right wisely. You never know if someone who's lost big reads this and you bring him/her down even more.",EDIT 2: thanks u/Conflixx for putting my point into better context than I did myself :),"The point of OP though is the fact that it seems like new people who just started with cryptocurrencies, as did I just start about 5-6 mo ths ago, are making fun of people who only just jumped the gun at it's ATH right before the market crashed. People who started when I did probably more then doubled their investment because of the amazing december bull run, those are the guys who're posting this bullshit all the time now. I tend to stay away from those memes, I mean.... You might just push someone over the edge to kill himself because he basically got himself into trouble by investing to much money. I sure as hell don't want anything to do with that. Even if it's only just a slight possibility, that's a big no-no for me.","That, or, people are using humor as a coping mechanism. I'm sure it's a bit of both.",Of course. We're all on this ride together. It's a fallacy to think that those who bought at $1k and rode to $20k then down to 8 or 9 have not lost as much from the peak as the people that bought there.,"We all had the choice to sell. Bitcoin doesn't know what you paid for it. We're all down, we're all in it together. So I've always taken those jokes as self-deprecating, rather than making fun of newbies.",You also have to admit that there is something absurd about what we're all doing. Magic internet money doesn't have to be taken quite so seriously.,4 more replies,4 more replies,The “weak hands / newbie” trope is unfair.,The only reason that BTC reached its all time high is because the new money came in from these investors. Without their involvement it would have stayed around the levels it’s at now all the way through December.,"I really hope that things level out, and I hope to see a multi trillion market cap in the coming year. But the growth from 100B upwards took a great deal of money. The growth from where we are today to the levels that we dream of needs a proportionally larger amount of money to come flooding into this space. The loss of momentum over the last four weeks - whether expected or not - means a lot of the newcomers have been badly burned.","Some will cash out, some will weather the storm and will keep hold of their portfolio in the hope that things turn around.",Some of us have been dealing with these issues for long enough to at least be able to show a little sympathy or empathy. The fact that a number of people somehow find it so fucking hilarious really doesn’t represent the community well.,You reasonable motherfucker.,"What's this you've said to me, my good friend? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and Ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target.

"In a deeply personal essay, youth worker Iain Stevens* tells of the small joys and savage pains of his work with some of our community’s most damaged families.I wondered what it was going to take to break my heart.I’ve been a youth advocate for just on four years. Moving all around West Auckland, inner to outer, New Lynn to Helensville, I’m deeply involved with kids and families who have fallen apart but have nowhere to go, so they have to stay in the place where the pain began.I’ve met no one bad yet. Busted-up and angry, suspicious and self-sabotaging, yes. But no one truly bad. The kids have trauma like soldiers have trauma. Exactly like soldiers: some of our streets are trenches, some of our interventions are weapons, some of our ideas are dangerous. The ones used in the past certainly were. Older workers talk about the way things have changed, how families are actually listened to now. I wonder how families survived the paternalism of the “old days”, when the state came down like a hammer.Today we still dictate too much. Our institutions are set up to ask the wrong questions, and they also can’t hear the answers through the noise of the system’s churn. There are good ideas out there – they just haven’t made it through to policy yet. Time will tell.When something won’t heal, it becomes a wound, painful and noticeable, and then what do you do? Pretend it’s not there? The families I see, most do pretend that they function properly and just get on with things. It’s not like they’re the only ones that live in this way – there are whole streets, out west, out east, down south, that are just holding on. The people who live there have learned to keep their heads down; piping up means getting slapped down.I’m in no way a shrinking violet. I’ve seen and done things that would shock most mothers – most relatives, really. I spent years with an addiction that – in order not to get ‘sick’, to keep from collapsing in withdrawal with barbed wire being pulled backwards through my veins – led to situations that, to this day, cause my left eyelid to flicker at their memory. I’ve seen some shit, I’ve done some shit.In many of my clients, I can see kindred spirits, fellow travellers who know how it feels to be a very small cog in a machine that chews you up if you squeak too hard. The survival attitude of “just hold on” is one I know intimately. That we are making a large swathe of our society live like this disgusts me. Too many of us believe that the poor somehow deserve their lot. Too many deny that our shared history has contributed to the present they find themselves in. We have a wound in this society; it’s scab that must be ripped off so we can look at the putrescence.Still, in some of the worst houses on good days, I have been privy to moments that have made my heart sing. The way humans can make joy is an endless sense of wonder to me, and to see that joy manifest is one of the blessings of being alive. Laughing with aunties. Watching girls twerk in school uniforms in front of their horrified mums. I’ve watched puppies flop down stairs in ways that have made me wee a bit with laughter. We know how to laugh in this country. We are really good at it, and we don’t do it enough.We have also gotten really good at ignoring our neighbours.And there are wastelands just next door, within earshot if you want to listen. All over the country there are big screens pulsing colours and energy into rooms that have neither. I can understand why you would want to get out of it, to remove yourself from these places for a while, at least in your mind. It’s hard to dream while staring at chipboard floors and walls grey-green with mould down to the skirting boards. Back and front yards just fences and grass, overgrown or perfunctorily mown, the edges tatty. Dead cars and broken furniture. The underlying smell of fried things.You shouldn’t dream here; these places are not made for fantasy, they’re places that should be changed. Being comfortable with this type of environment will kill you; the mould will get in your lungs, the damp will give you eczema. Or maybe someone will explode with pent-up impotent rage and attack anyone within range. You should escape from it. People like me should help you leave.It takes technique, resilience and often some emotional sleight-of-hand to get a person who isn’t used to talking to talk. But they all will, eventually. The chest will un-puff, the dog will be told to sit the fuck down, the look of “what will this Pākehā promise me?” will leave their face. Sometimes I’ll get a cup of tea, or I’ll sit while they smoke and we’ll let the silence do the introductions. Most mums love to chat about their kids.

My father was a policeman and I knock like he did. I apologise for it all the time. Trust can be hard to win and the initial few minutes can taint the outreach irreparably. I want to be easy to know, I want it to seem like their homes don’t bother me. Most of the time I can pull this off; only sometimes will I involuntarily crinkle my nose or stare too long. And then I’ll realise I’ve been caught out – not judging, just honestly confused at how people can live amongst this squalor with the smells and the cold and the colds without going crazy and soaking themselves in booze or whatever is at hand so that they can sleep at night. And then I just close my mouth, turn my head, do some mental gymnastics to inure myself, because staring is what too many are doing already. It’s my job to try to change this, it’s my job to make some sense in senselessness. To help humans live humanely.I wondered what it was going to take to break my heart. And I can feel the image looming and I don’t want to describe it. Because I’m going to remember that I walked away that day. I said nothing, I failed to help. But it triggered a feeling so visceral that later I saw the outline of a Subaru Legacy logo on my palm. I’d gripped my keys so tight I’d imprinted it into my flesh.First, another story. There was a split family I worked with, trying to get a child back to school. The child was truant on the days that the dad was scheduled to do the school pick-up. The mother’s side of the family had alleged abuse and a court case was pending, but before it came up they were having to live with the fact of a cousin abusing one of the children. The mother knew; she’d laid charges as yet unproven. But agencies and the other side of the family were demanding that the visitation rights were met and so she had to let her kids be picked up from her house to spend days with the father’s family, and the cousin.She more than “knew” – she knew, but was told she would be arrested if she in any way hindered the pick-up. She was hard to deal with and belligerent; if she had any sense of being shunned, she’d act up, and she defended her child to the hilt. After a family conference, the agreement was made that the visits would continue. The lawyers and CYFS had agreed to this. The child was to be given to a predator, until the law said otherwise.That night I could barely sleep. In the morning, I’d decided that I would side with the mother. I’d stand in front of whoever came and not let the child go. I thought I could not do my job in good conscience if I allowed this to happen without making myself heard. But as I drove to work the next day I got a text saying that the cousin had admitted the abuse. I cried with the mother. It felt like a difference had been made, and I’d been around to see it. I patted my back a little bit.The next week the mum, who has a history with our service, had a meltdown and demanded to lay a complaint against me. I’d “done nothing,” “hadn’t helped a bit”. My co-workers talked her down and after a while she came round and apologised. But something has changed, our rapport has been dented. She needed to lash out and I was the closest one that day. I wore it, but it’s tainted my joy a bit. I think this is still a success. Time will tell.

That is not what broke my heart.There are these kids that can’t get off synthetics. Even when they were outlawed everyone knew the shops that still had them or the houses of the people who had stocks.I started this job a few months after they were taken off the market, and the workload was immense. The burnout of confused, blendered brains bashed by chemicals; the heaviest users were schizoaffective. If you ask me, in a land with such quality marijuana as New Zealand, these toxic chemical grenades are totally unnecessary.We were tasked with counselling people while they came down from years of having synthetics in their system. The confusions receded, and the families were getting back in touch, happy that their whānau had returned to the land of the thinking. Then we all found out that they were set to come back into shops and I started fielding calls from parents and Nanas and Poppas asking why this poison is still allowed to be sold. I tell them to write to Peter Dunne c/o Parliament House, Private Bag, Lambton Quay, Wellington. No need for a stamp.I went to see a family about their son in youth prison. He was 14 and had more charges than his age. I was going to get some support around his exit from the system. I wanted to talk to his parents about the options: maybe we could get him in an immersion program, to get him thinking about his strengths. How working with others is necessary to get some things done, how working with others is how we discover things about them and ourselves. See who can handle three weeks in a tent outside Gisborne, making some tools, killing some possums. Learning that human connection means more than wifi status, that anger is good but so is empathy. Things some homes can’t teach.And this home was definitely one of the worse ones I’d seen. In the corners of the lounge were bags of cheap alcohol cans, empty except for the sickly sweet smell of cola. The windows were open but in Auckland this is not necessarily a good thing; it was 27 degrees and humid, like walking through soup. This house smelt like an old casserole dish wrapped in a dog blanket, a couch with bare foam squabs emitting puffs of dirty air whenever someone sat on it. Mum, high on something, was up and down like Nick Smith in the debating chamber on a dissembling jag. Carpetless floors with piles of dirt around table legs, trails scuffed through the muck on the floor. Mum and Dad smoked constantly and talked about getting their son back so they’d get more accommodation supplement, or more basic benefit, or something.My phone was running flat and I asked if they had a USB charger,“Over there on the kitchen bench.” I got up to plug my phone in, and looked through an open door into the hallway. I noticed the hallway was carpeted, and something went through my mind that I can’t remember; something like “at least there’s some carpet.” It was the same colour as the dirt on the chipboard floor. I saw further into the hallway and saw a baby gate across it, making a space about the size of a big suitcase against a closed door. Behind the gate was a child less than a year old. I couldn’t tell if it was a boy or a girl. The child was naked but for a bulging nappy, brown at the edges. A large tin of baked beans lay on its side, spilling its contents on the carpet. The child was turned away from me, eating the beans straight off the carpet. Some of them had been smeared and crushed into the carpet. The baby was sitting on some sauce, its hands and cheeks covered in fluff and dirt and sauce and beans, and at the noise of my phone on the bench the baby turned and looked straight at me with eyes like a deep answer to a question I didn’t know how to ask and my heart broke.I could not say anything. Maybe as I mature as a person, and a professional, I’ll be able to react differently but that time, I had nothing.Maybe I’ll be able to gently chide the family. “Aue, your baby needs a wipe eh? They’ve made a mess – let’s clean it up hey?”Not that time. I pretended my phone did not fit their cord. I had to jam my hands into my pockets because they had begun to shake. I held my keys hard. I was going to walk out of there and get into my car and drive away and try to process what I had just seen.I forgot my diary and had to go back later to pick it up. They said that they had passed my number on to their son so that I could talk to him directly about what was going on. “Just let us know when he’ll be back so we can tell WINZ.”The boy texted me a couple of days later, I told him about his options and asked what he thought. It will be challenging at the camp, I said, but the outcomes will be all good. The course sounds choice, it’s been running 23 years and only four boys have quit and only two stayed quit. It’s long though; it’ll be almost August by the time you get back home.“Is there somewhere else I can go if I don’t want to go home?”I texted, “That’s not a question I can answer, if that’s what you feel like, you have to let your parents know.”“I don’t know how to talk to them I don’t know what to say”I knew how he felt.“We’ve got 9 weeks, we’ll work out something.”I think this could be a success. Time will tell. Postscript: The service has assigned a CSW to help the family navigate through their benefit entitlements, and they have received a food parcel and some funding for carpet cleaning, which has begun the process of making the house better for its youngest members.* Not his real name – to protect his job and the families involved we have withheld Iain’s identity.",I wondered what it was going to take to break my heart.,"I’ve been a youth advocate for just on four years.

Busted-up and angry, suspicious and self-sabotaging, yes. But no one truly bad. The kids have trauma like soldiers have trauma.

A prospectus contains this and other information about the ETF and should be read carefully before investing. Customers should obtain prospectuses from issuers and/or their third party agents who distribute and make prospectuses available for review.

Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk it does not assure a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities, or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not currently backed nor supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. Trading in cryptocurrencies comes with significant risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Cryptocurrency trading requires knowledge of cryptocurrency markets. In attempting to profit through cryptocurrency trading, you must compete with traders worldwide. You should have appropriate knowledge and experience before engaging in substantial cryptocurrency trading. Cryptocurrency trading may not generally be appropriate, particularly with funds drawn from retirement savings, student loans, mortgages, emergency funds, or funds set aside for other purposes. Cryptocurrency trading can lead to large and immediate financial losses. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position quickly at a reasonable price. This can occur, for example, when the market for a particular cryptocurrency suddenly drops, or if trading is halted due to recent news events, unusual trading activity, or changes in the underlying cryptocurrency system. Several federal agencies have also published advisory documents surrounding the risks of virtual currency.

As expected, Bill Clinton is going to get a gushier treatment. Post writer Neely Tucker is so tender to the president that he mangles a fact, and the copy editors (also tender hearts) allowed it. “Fact Checker” Glenn Kessler will not be assigned to this story.","Tucker wrote, “He allegedly cheated on his wife, repeatedly, even in the Oval Office, and with a young woman who wasn’t that much older than their daughter.”","This came right after Tucker warned,","Heading into the homestretch, it seems obvious that even if he makes no further mistakes, even if he gives brilliant tactical advice, promotes inspiring programs for the working class and offers soaring rhetoric about the Great Promise of America, he is still going to be pilloried by opponents as being morally unfit to return to the White House.","Are “opponents” then, correct to “allege” – employing DNA-test results – that the president had an affair with intern? Sure enough, Tucker makes a “blue dress” joke, so he’s well-aware of the facts. But then he gets to compare and contrast. His competition for presidential spouse is a lying supermodel who got naked for photographers, so it’s all good:","Fortunately for Team Clinton, there is Team Trump.","America’s alternative first spouse is Melania Trump. Her website had said she has a college degree (she has also testified in court that she has one), but journalists who have examined her academic record report they could not verify it.","In her one and only campaign speech, she plagiarized Michelle Obama. Also, the third wife of the Republican nominee once posed nude for the cover of British GQ. The headline: “NAKED SUPERMODEL SPECIAL!”  ","In the battle of spouses, it is Bill “blue dress” Clinton vs. Melania “no dress” Trump. Vote your conscience, America.",Tucker began the piece with the usual Post cup full of sugar:,"The plane descends through a haze of afternoon heat and humidity, the Arkansas River appearing as a lazy brown ribbon running through fields of green. There, flanking its southern banks, lies the City of Clinton, also known as Little Rock.","Once the plane touches down at Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport, it’s a short drive downtown to the William J. Clinton Presidential Center, the primary feature of which is the William J. Clinton Library and Museum.","Here, you can stroll into the Clinton Presidential Park and across the Clinton Presidential Park Bridge. Or you can walk west onto President Clinton Avenue, taking you through the city’s hip River Market district.","It could be suggested this sugar was tactical, so that the Post could note that perhaps the Big Dog needs to stay on the porch and not keep too high a profile. They note the oh-so-cooperative national Democrat media play along, and don’t even send reporters to his events:","As the rain pummels the roof, they have him all to themselves. The media platform is near empty. A couple of newspapers, some local television. Exactly two national news organizations applied for accreditation.","For the Hillary Clinton campaign, this is perfect.... [Italics in the original.]","Bill Clinton, who famously loves to talk, has made more than 400 appearances at fundraisers, rallies, shopping malls and so forth in support of his wife’s campaign in the past eight months — but has not given a sit-down interview since last fall.",Tucker mentions that Bill bumbled it by meeting Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the airport before Hillary was (shocker) not indicted in the e-mail scandal. But was that really done without Hillary's knowledge?,"Democrats all recall that Bill ""embarrassed"" her by whacking Barack Obama too hard in the primaries in 2008. (Call Obama inexperienced? That was apparently racist.) But then the media-Democrat complex all believes he's a political genius, which Tucker (like a good Democrat) repeats, as if this notion is required in every Bill Clinton profile:","Bill Clinton is one of the most brilliant political minds of his generation. He’s the original political star in the family. Despite his well-documented shortcomings, he is still his wife’s best fundraiser, and “both from a substantive but also tactical perspective,” Mook says, “he’s really our most valuable surrogate.”","He certainly seems like a more valuable surrogate when newspapers will still distort the record and use the word ""alleged"" for his ""well-documented shortcomings."" He's a brilliant tactician....except for the cheating-and-impeachment stuff those opponents rudely bring up.",Please support NewsBusters today!

" Prime Minister John Key has been accused of ""dictatorial"" behaviour over his threats to overrule the Auckland Council if it does not agree to free up more land for housing."," New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said Mr Key was ""bullying"" the council by discussing the prospect of commissioners for the city."," ""That's dictatorial. It's arrogant,"" Mr Peters said in a speech at the University of Auckland today."," Last week, Mr Key said last week that land supply issues had been largely been solved in Christchurch using the power of Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and commissioners."," Those same supply issues were now present in Auckland, he said, hinting at Christchurch-like special powers to fix the housing shortage."," Mr Key clarified today that the Government was not considering commissioners in Auckland. However, he said, the Auckland Council would lose the final say on whether land was freed-up for housing."," The Government will soon release a National Policy Statement which will force growing councils to release more land for residential development if specific thresholds for growth or affordability are reached. The Prime Minister confirmed that the statement would include income-to-price ratios, which would trigger local authorities to release land if a region's median house price far outstripped median income."," The plans to get rid of urban development restrictions have raised concerns about how the heavily-indebted Auckland Council will pay for the roads, water pipes, and schools which are needed for new housing developments.", Mr Key said the council might have to sell assets to cover infrastructure costs. But he would not be drawn on what the council could sell.," ""It's not for the Government to decide the makeup of Auckland Council's balance sheet. But it is appropriate that the Auckland Council looks at the balance sheet and how if might fund the growth and needs of Auckland city."""," Councils are able to collect levies from developers for infrastructure, but those levies are partly blamed for the high cost of housing.", The Auckland Council wants congestion charges to pay for new infrastructure. The Government has rejected the initiative.," In his speech this afternoon, Mr Peters blamed ""peak immigration"" for the Auckland's housing problems."," ""Too many people. Not enough homes,"" he said, noting that half of the annual arrivals of 70,000 were settling in Auckland."," The Government has previously said that high net migration was just one part of an rare ""trifecta"" which is putting pressure on housing - along with record low interest rates and high confidence in the economy."," It has ruled out restrictions on demand, saying stamp duties and bans on foreign buyers in other countries have not made houses more affordable."
createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');                                            Hollis Johnson                                    Two reporters. , Seven-and-a-half hours. , Thirty-four plates of shrimp. ," Red Lobster's ""Endless Shrimp"" promotion is a yearly phenomenon. However, as two shrimp-loving reporters, we couldn't help but wonder: how endless is the shrimp? "," Early in September, Red Lobster announced the return of its famed deal. For $21.99 — likely cheaper in markets outside of New York City — you can go and eat as many shrimp as you can. "," But this deal seems to good to be true. Surely, Red Lobster wouldn't want you to gorge on shrimp for hours on end? And there's no way that the 100th shrimp would taste nearly as good as the first, right? ", Wrong. ," Here's our intrepid crustaceous crusade from sweaty ""Shrimp Madness"" to shrimp ecstasy. "," The cool, late summer breeze made us feel as though we belonged on a pebble beach with a shrimp cocktail in one hand, and a regular cocktail in the other. "," We arrived to the Times Square Red Lobster with a plan in mind: to stay as long as possible, eating shrimp the entire time. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner: shrimp. "," We had called ahead and told Red Lobster of our intentions — for journalism's sake — hoping to reduce the chance of being expelled for our time-consuming shrimp consumption. The restaurant said it should be no problem, with no formal time limits to the promotion. "," In 2015, Red Lobster increased the size of its shrimp by  47% in an effort to combat complaints of sub-par shrimp size. "," With the larger shrimp in mind, we were concerned regarding how many shrimp we could actually down in a day. We decided upon a goal of 100 shrimp between us, hoping to try each of the five types of shrimp under the promotion. "," While there are other shrimp items on Red Lobster's menu, only these five are part of the ""Endless Shrimp"" deal. Although there is a secret Endless Shrimp menu — but let's not get ahead of ourselves. "," Red Lobster's Times Square location is the epitome of upscale nautical chain decor: dim lighting, no windows (not unlike a casino), rich and dark varnished wood, and a playlist ranging from Mumford & Sons to dulcet, smooth Dad-rock tones. "," Our fearless server Jonathan — truly our Virgil through this crustaceous Divine Comedy — gave us a full spiel on the menu and the Endless Shrimp deal. He dutifully told us of Red Lobster's fresh fish offerings and the like, but we only had eyes for one special snack of the sea: shrimp. "," The deal comes with a salad, one side, and an endless supply of the iconic Cheddar Bay biscuits. But when aiming to push the limits of shrimp consumption by sheer numbers, some sacrifices have to be made. ",Forget the Lobsterita: your drink of choice is water. Hydration is key. ," The choice of sides includes an array of starches, including a sweet corn ""cobbette"", roasted baby potatoes, the new whipped sweet potatoes with pecans, as well as broccoli and brussel sprouts. "," The best choices here are the greens. The starches will fill you up faster than the nets of a shrimp trawler off the coast of Louisiana, and you need to save your appetite for the shrimp. "," Sadly, the same advice goes for the Cheddar Bay biscuits; as alluring the aroma may be, they are best left untouched. Don't worry — you can request a bag to go to enjoy at your leisure, post-shrimp coma. "," The salad is an easy choice: either a garden salad, or a Caesar salad. Obviously go with the iceberg-laden garden salad, as the Caesar dressing is starting on the wrong foot — and this is a marathon, folks. "," Finally, the hour is at hand. Our first orders arrive, along with our sprouts. Hollis' order was the peppercorn and parmesan shrimp, and the garlic sriracha-grilled shrimp. Your first round includes two orders; every order hereafter is one at a time. "," From the first bite, we realized that the peppercorn and parmesan shrimp were something special. They're a new-comer this year, bringing a salty, cheesy, and herb-heavy taste to the more traditional breaded shrimp. The accompanying lemon aioli is decent, but heavy — a dab will do you. "," The garlic sriracha-grilled shrimp is another new addition to the Endless Shrimp menu; they're certainly garlicky, and the sriracha drizzled over the grilled and skewered shrimp packs some sharp heat. ", Kate ordered the shrimp scampi and the garlic sriracha-grilled shrimp for her first round. ," The scampi, as Kate so aptly puts it, is truly the bread and butter of Endless Shrimp. At times, the butter sea the shrimp swims in can be overwhelming, but with a simple shake of the shrimp, the excess is dispatched and there is no better shrimp to be had. "," It's a delicate dish, and when the butter is at lower levels, the bright lemon flavor shines through. ",Shrimp count (combined): 27 , A mythical figure soon emerged from the salty fogs of Endless Shrimp lore: Vince. ," Legend has it (according to our waiter, Jonathan) that Vince shows up regularly to this location of Red Lobster to take advantage of the promotion, sometimes ordering up to 30 plates of scampi. Just the day before, Jonathan reported Vince's shrimpy spread included 17 orders of scampi and two orders of the pasta alfredo. "," We were shocked to learn of Vince's inclusion of shrimp alfredo in his feast. To order the carb-loaded, cream-based dish seemed like true hubris in the face of the Endless Shrimp spirit: surely just one order would fill you up prematurely, let alone two. ",Shrimp count: 43 ," The shrimp scampi is a dish so closely linked to the legendary shrimper that when he walks in, they know to begin preparation immediately. "," And we can see why — the scampi is a gem. It's wildly enjoyable to eat, albeit messy, but is far from filling. With an average of five shrimp per scampi dish, it's a light, buttery respite on your culinary odyssey. "," The traditional breaded shrimp are basically the peppercorn and parmesan shrimp, without the vaguely Italian flavor blast. It's the tried and true classic that's... fine. The cocktail sauce that comes with it is probably the most exciting part; it's acidic, vinegary, and it breaks up the monotony of the breaded shrimp as we cruised past the 50 shrimp mark. ",Shrimp count: 58 ," We've tried 'em all, and we like 'em all. "," It feels as though we've only just sat down, despite being a good hour and a half in. The shrimp puns are as endless as the shrimp, and spirits are high. "," We were so excited about shrimp, we began drafting our shrimp-inspired Halloween costume ideas. ""We're shrimp champs, not shrimp chumps!"" became our mantra. ",Shrimp count: 72 ," Two hours in, and we've heard three different Mumford & Sons songs. Kate downloaded the Shazam app to figure out what other songs were playing — they were familiar, yet the names always just out grasp. [sidenote: ""Superwoman"" by Shontelle is a great song.]"," We realize that the 100-shrimp goal is far too easy. We were already cruising in on the mark, and we were feeling fine. If we were doing this at our leisure, then perhaps this would have been a good moment to stop — but this wasn't about fun. This was about the challenge. ",Shrimp count: 82 ," Our coworkers — and presumably, fans — were growing concerned at this point. Our editor tweeted, ""OMG concerned"" in response to our increasingly absurd shrimp tweets. "," We appeared live on Business Insider's Facebook Live feed, sharing our strategies, stories, and current state of physical and emotional health. Everyone seemed suspicious of how happy were, but concern was far from our minds as we crushed the 100-shrimp mark. "," Brushing aside the previous goal with ease, we set a new target: 200 shrimp. ",Shrimp count: 102 , The shrimp is still tasting very good — maybe too good. ," At three hours in, we began to feel a bit like the Shrimp Family Robinson, cast away on Red Lobster's Endless Shrimp lsland. We felt disconnected from the outside world, and time was no longer moving in a linear fashion. The possibility of hallucination haunted the table — we swear we spotted a Microsoft Zune charging in the distance, five years after being discontinued. "," Fortunately, the garlic sriracha shrimp provided an anchor to our sanity. The sriracha cut through the shrimpy monotony, providing brief respites of lucidity. "," Also, we noticed the stunning plating, with the sriracha lovingly drizzled across the grilled crustacean. ",Shrimp count: 126 , Shrimp Madness was in full swing. , We began to concoct a shrimp-based staging of Sartre's 'No Exit' as we happily munched on scampi. ," The haunting play is best summed up with the line: ""L'enfer, c'est les autres,"" or ""Hell is other people."" Our version of the play, set in the windowless second story of the Time Square Red Lobster, instead hypothesizes that ""L'enfer, c'est les plus de crevettes,"" or ""Hell is more shrimp."" "," On Kate's fourth personal serving of scampi, she was shocked by how good it was. "," ""Now this is a good scampi,"" she said, emphatically. "," To be fair, the shrimp were not drowning in this rich butter sauce, but instead lounging as if dipping their shrimpy periopods and pleopods in the jus of the sea, while sunning on the beach at Sandal's resort. ", This was indeed a good scampi. ,Shrimp count: 142 ," The Red Lobster manager, who had been periodically checking in on us, asked us if we heard of the secret menu. "," Our jaws dropped, and our half-eaten shrimp hit the plates. "," There are three items that are not on the official Endless Shrimp menu that customers can, in fact, order as part of the promotion. Prime among these: coconut popcorn shrimp. "," These tailless tropical wonders are complete game changers. Just as the creeping danger of flavor fatigue threatened to put us out of the game, coconut popcorn shrimp lit a fire beneath us. The dish was slightly sweet, thanks to the coconut shreds worked into the crispy breading. "," And the sauce — oh! the sauce. The delicious melange of piña colada-inspired flavors included juicy chunks of pineapple and a creamy coconut base. Hollis soon began eating the sauce with a fork, throwing carbo-caution to the wind. "," As Ray LaMontagne's ""You Are the Best Thing"" played over Red Lobster's speakers, we agreed: this coconut popcorn shrimp was truly The Best Thing. ",Shrimp count: 195 ," As we each passed our individual 100-shrimp marks, we allowed ourselves a treat. Jonathan recommended pairing the Endless Shrimp with a refreshing mojito. Hoping the mint would bolster digestion, we gladly ordered one each. "," However, Kate was floundering. She'd been hit with the shrimp sweats, and the sheer amount of shrimp was beginning to weigh upon her. She slowed her pacing, and was forced to follow the mojito with a ginger ale, in hopes that she could rally as the shrimp count blossomed. "," Meanwhile, Hollis was having no such problem. "," Emboldened by the coconut popcorn shrimp, he proclaimed shrimp to be the candy of the sea. And indeed, he was throwing back those coconut shrimp like TicTacs, racking up a healthy count. The shrimp count soared as the popcorn shrimp took center stage. ",Shrimp count: 235 ," The shrimp linguini alfredo dwarfed the other options in terms of calorie count: 620 compared to the other dishes' 250 calorie range. We knew we had to try it, as we had pledged to try all available dishes, but we were wary. The dish combined shrimp with the carbo-load of pasta, plus the cream bomb of alfredo. ", We worried that just a few bites would capsize our maritime mission just as we neared safe harbor. ," It was 6 pm, and we'd been at Red Lobster for six-and-a-half hours. We feverishly crunched the numbers and devised a foolproof plan for the final sprint: Hollis would go all-in on the coconut popcorn to rack up the numbers and Kate would bravely tackle the enigmatic pasta dish. "," Was this to be a shrimpy Waterloo, a mere few dozen shrimp away from the goal? Or, would we triumph in our gastronomical quest? ",Shrimp count: 276 ," The Red Lobster gods smiled down on us from their perches in Orlando, Florida (Red Lobster's headquarters). The shrimp in the pasta alfredo were blessedly small and numerous.  ", Hollis was eating the coconut popcorn shrimp like he was born to do it. Do we believe in destiny? Perhaps. ," We  counted down the 10 final shrimp live, alternating pasta and popcorn. Our fans — fellow Business Insider colleagues and Jonathan — cheered as we clinked our forks and cleared the 300-shrimp mark. "," It was a joyous and bountiful Shrimpsgiving, indeed.  ", S hrimp count: 300 ," Nearly eight hours after we ate our first shrimp, Red Lobster was still cooking up winners. Hollis continued to eat shrimp, not wanting a single nugget to go to waste. As the plates were cleared, he had personally consumed 162 shrimp. "," Kate, not far behind, netted 143 shrimp. She pawned her remaining prawns off on Hollis and on-lookers — but she wasn't quite done with Red Lobster for the night. "," The alluring Cheddar Bay biscuits had been singing their cheesy siren song all day. And at last, we gave in, asking for a fresh bag to go, as is every Endless Shrimp-goer's right. ", We learned a lot that day at Red Lobster. ," We found the chain's shrimp to far exceed expectations. We discovered the human capacity for shrimp consumption is great and inspiring. We met one of the kindest servers to be found in the world, in the form of Red Lobster's shining star, Jonathan. ", Would we do it all again? Certainly. ," We're already planning for Shrimpsgiving 2017. The quality is great, and the quantity is endless. And, be on the lookout for Kate Taylor and Hollis Johnson's Off-Off-Off Broadway production of ""No Exit: Gone Shrimpin'."" ",Final shrimp count: 305 , Like what you see here?

Here is the CNN Article Titled: Georgia lawmaker: Can people with HIV be 'legally' quarantined?,What CNN Claims she said.,"""What are we legally able to do?"" Dr. Betty Price, a Republican, asked Dr. Pascale Wortley, director of the HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Surveillance Section at the Georgia Department of Public Health. ""I don't want to say the 'quarantine' word, but I guess I just said it. ... What would you advise, or are there any methods, legally, that we could do that would curtail the spread?""",Here is the video of her testimony.,What she ACTUALLY said.,"""Before you proceed, if you wouldn't mind commenting on the surveillance of partners and the tracking of contacts, that sort of thing. What are we legally able to do?"" Dr. Betty Price, a Republican, asked Dr. Pascale Wortley, director of the HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Surveillance Section at the Georgia Department of Public Health. ""I don't want to say the 'quarantine' word, but I guess I just said it. ... What would you advise, or are there any methods, legally, that we could do that would curtail the spread?""","Why is that line important? Well, if you go to 57 minutes in the video, you'll note the HIV specialist is discussing a very specific population. People who are getting diagnosed and then refusing treatment, or people who get treatment and then stop treatment. This is an issue because keeping HIV at a ""suppressed"" viral load makes it very difficult to transmit. If people stop their medication, they remain at a higher load and can spread it easier.","The lawmaker here is a doctor, and she's asking what they can legally do in order to get into contact with people who have been exposed, and people who are NOT going to care, to get care or hold them responsible for their higher rates of transmission. This is a concern because as the doctor said, there is a HUGE difference between people who take their drugs consistently, and those who either do not, or who only go to treatment ""intermittently"" (When they get sick).","Instead of presenting the conversation in context, or hell even fully quoting her--they are attempting to rail road her, even going so far as to literally simply fabricate something she had not said.",CNN being dishonest hacks?

But I suppose you will be first in line to hire someone who admits to having such desires? Or the first to patronise such a business?

It's retribution.,...and?,THINK OF THE CHILDREN,When the discussion is pedophilia then it would be bizarre not to frankly. Think a little before you say dumb shit like that.,"Do...do you not understand what that phrasing means?  Sigh I'll explain. Basically, a 'think of the children' argument is one that literally begins and ends its argument there. No logical reasoning or support, just an appeal to emotion designed to influence opinion by pretending it's 'better' for the kids, regardless of whether there is any substance to the argument or not.",pretending it's 'better' for the kids,We are talking about children being raped. Not being sexually abused is better. Not 'better'. Better. Its not pretending either. It really is better not to be raped.,You are one of those people whose idea of logic is to trot out rote phrases and have clearly never thought about what they mean.,"It's absolutely reasonable to begin and end an argument about child rape with the risk being posed to the children. You have just rote learned a phrase which implies its never ok. Now you've admitted to the world that you're not that smart. Next time someone brings up the reintroduction of corporal punishment to school, dont go shouting WONT SOMEONE THINK OF THE CHILDREN like a dog wagging his tail over his own shit.",Serial killers should absolutely be executed.,"We should be executing anyone found guilty of child molestation. That we don't is where your ""feels"" are interfering with the good of society both short and long-term.","Oh, man, the irony. Listen carefully, son, I'll explain why you're 100% wrong.","First of all, you are the one advocating for feels, because killing someone simply because you find their crime to be too disgusting is an emotional response, not a rational one. Logically speaking, there is no reason why killing a child molester would benefit society. In fact, such a law would probably end up in more children dying.","The studies on capital punishment are all there. It has been proven again and again that the death penalty doesn't deter crime. It doesn't rehabilitate. It doesn't fix anything. That's why every country has abolished it, with the exception of the US, Japan, and a bunch of shitty third world countries. From a moral philosophy standpoint, the death penalty is anti-liberal, because it gives the state the power to kill its own citizens, and no government should have that right.","But, since you care so much about children, let me tell you the main reason your idea is so stupid: If molesting children was punishable by death, then every single child molester would kill their victims.","You see, most criminals try to break as few laws as possible, because, if they get caught, all of their crimes are accumulated. You robbed a bank? With an illegal firearm? You beat up the bank teller? You took hostages? All of these crimes will lead to a greater sentencing. But if you impose the absolute maximum sentence for only one crime, then the criminal suddenly has nothing to lose. They can break every single law in the book and still receive the same punishment. So, someone who has just molested a child will probably want to kill that child, because getting rid of witnesses is the first thing criminals care about. So, in other words, your law would compel child molesters to kill their victims. Your law would cause more children to die.","But wait, there's more! Since most child molestations occur from close relatives, your law would produce another problem. If, say, a little girl is being serially molested by her uncle, she will be less likely to step forward and tell people about it, because she wouldn't want to be the reason her uncle is executed. Children are already reluctant of getting their relatives in trouble as it is, and this has been researched extensively. So, killing child molesters would also disincentivize victims from stepping forward!","So, that's why we don't kill child molesters. Not because of feels, but because of science and reason. You're the one who wants to lynch people because of an emotional response.","Oh, and by the way, the other dude is right. Non-offending pedophiles need treatment, not stigmatization. Stigma makes pedophiles less likely to seek help, thus increasing the probability of offending.",Lighten up on those child molesters or they might punish you by turning into child killers. Awesome game theory.,"Alternative suggestion: we execute child molesters, but we torture and execute child killers.","fyi there's a difference between discreet and discrete and while you probably meant the other, it could the be interpreted either way","Cheers, I never knew.

I misread your misreading. Yay for communication via text?,I think we should just blame Gamergate so neither of us will have to be responsible for our mistakes.,There is an ongoing attempt to have pedophilia downgraded from a disorder to simply a sexual orientation (already separate conditions in the DSM).,"Trying to separate the act from the desire, ive heard things like ""as long as they don't act on it, where's the harm"", and ""who are you to say what people should want""...

I don't care how many thoughts or urges you have for something, if you never commit the act then you haven't harmed anyone.

It's clear (usually by the content of the conversations prior to them coming to the home) that the encounter was meant to be sexual. That's a massively far cry from someone coming out and saying they have these attractions looking for help.,We have no way of knowing if the ones looking for help are not simultaneously preying on kids,"Okay, but preying on kids is already a crime. Therefore, lock up the ones committing the fucking crimes, it's not rocket science.","and to think they aren't just because they are 'brave' is naive, and to think that they are forever incorruptible is moronic.",I never said any of this.,A lot of paedophiles feel that way,[Citation needed],"so the current move to tolerate and accept it is very dangerous, as it'll just increase the amount of open paedophiles in the wild, giving them a greater voice and ability to share ideas and organise.

Justice systems all over the civilised world are based on ""innocent until proven guilty"" for a good reason. Making an exception to this is just pushing them deeper underground in their hugboxes.

If you actually clicked the article, you couldn't miss them putting her words into context because it does the annoying thing of auto-playing it. She did say the ""Quarantine"" word and asked what could legally be done to curtail the spread.",She said the word to literally say she didn't want to make allusions to it. She was LITERALLY denying what CNN said she wanted. And this is very clear when you see the full context. (I'll detail it below),"They provided what she said, in context, a little backround on her, and HIV, GLAAD's response to her, and this part at the end:",Men and women who are HIV-positive can virtually eliminate their chances of transmitting the virus if they are under proper care.,"I'm glad they said this...because that's exactly, LITERALLY what the doctors were discussing in the video. Which illustrates this organization didn't actually watch the full transcript. But as said, I'll break down the context for you.","See the bold part I wrote in? (About tracking partners) That's specifically what CNN cut from the article (But they left it in the video). That references the population they are speaking of AND the subject they are speaking on. The HIV expert from the health department was discussing people who come in, get diagnosed, get Anti-Viral treatment and then discontinue their medication","The discussion was on that group, and why they do this. Because as the HIV expert explained, people on the Anti-Virals go into a ""suppressed"" state where HIV is not even detectable and the rate of transmission is nearly non-existent. So the committee asked why they do this, asked whether it was an access to drugs issue or treatment ect. The HIV expert said its multiple factors, but some of them come down to people simply not believing they have the virus, and the medical community is scamming them. This of course is dangerous because these people have jumps in viral load which can make the disease transmittable again, AND they don't believe they have it, so they can continue on with risky behavior.","Dr Price (The woman in the video) then specifically asks Before you proceed, if you wouldn't mind commenting on the surveillance of partners and the tracking of contacts, that sort of thing. She then asks what they are legally able to do (About stopping these people from exposing others). She specifically says she doesn't want to bring up the word quarantine, but does want to know what they can do to limit intentional exposure given privacy laws.","At no point does she ask to quarantine people, in fact the word was said to specifically illustrate she was not asking about that. She was speaking of a specific demographic of people who were refusing treatment, and how they can protect potentially intimate partners of those people, and what legal remedies there are. Nothing in there says what you believe it does. Please, watch the video I linked--that's the full testimony and illustrates the conversation in context.","And CNN asked for her comment: ""Price's office did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for comment.""","They just literally made up a headline, and completely distorted what she said in a discussion that has a complete, public visual and auditory record for anyone to see. They were confident enough people wouldn't watch the public record, that I even linked, to do that--to just flat out lie. And you believe somehow its a sign of guilt she doesn't want to comment to a reporter one on one? Even if she records it, she can't put her recording into any organization with as much reach as CNN, and they've shown a willingness to paraphrase and straight up fabricate.",Would you comment? You'd be better off attempting to defend your point of view within Daily Show interview.,On one hand you are correct when you say the article doesn't tell any direct lies. On the other hand I read the article without watching the video and I saw no hint that she was talking about a sub group of HIV carriers.,It actually seemed to do the opposite and implied she was talking about them all with lines like this:,"An estimated 1.1 million people in the United States were living with HIV at the end of 2014, the most recent year for which this information is available","What she actually said was still completely ridiculous. I dont know why they didn't just honestly explain her position. If you ignore the video, as I almost always do and I imagine I'm not alone, then its just not true that CNN were honest here.",Edit: forgot a word,"No, they literally lied. She never asked about quarantining HIV victims. She said specifically she didn't want to use that word. She was being careful because they were discussing legal measures to contact partners and contacts of people who were infected and then choose to stop treatment because they ""don't really have it.""","I'm not sure how you feel what she said was ridiculous? The HIV expert gave her a very serious problem in the southern part of her state. People who were stopping treatment and then allowing their viral load to build, and still exposing others because they believed they were cured. She was asking for what legal recourse they had to stop this.",She said specifically she didn't want to use that word.,She specifically chose that word and didn't correct herself. Saying you dont want to use a word but then admitting that you are in fact using that word means that you are using the word. Its pretty basic reading comprehension.,I'm not sure how you feel what she said was ridiculous?,Its threat to public safety isn't high enough to impose that degree of draconian enforcement.,"Apart from the authoritarianism, how much would it cost to enforce? Since perpatrators could presumably just move beyond state lines and come back to her state as often as they liked, would all that cost in both money and freedom actually change anything?",She specifically chose that word and didn't correct herself. Saying you dont want to use a word but then admitting that you are in fact using that word means that you are using the word. Its pretty basic reading comprehension.,"Pretty basic reading comprehension would be her realizing that she was trying to head off any supposition at the pass, but then even uttering the word was probably a mistake. However, she's a professional (A doctor) speaking to other doctors, and the context was crystal clear within the meeting, so she disregarded it without believing Reddit was going to go viral. (And lets note: She wasn't speaking about potential policy. She was asking for the expert to give her full breadth of knowledge so the committee she is on can make informed choices.)","In her position, she probably could not have fathomed this would have happened given how CLEAR the context was. Surely no one would take her saying she DOES NOT want to say quarantine as her asking about quarantine when the sentence before she was literally asking about a contact surveillance program, right?","Well, she'd be wrong...Because people are really poor at not only basic reading comprehension, but also resisting their biases and paying attention to context. (It's genuinely not easy for me to defend her, I disagree with her on many issues. But clearly in the meeting she's concerned with a specific thing, and at no point is asking to quarantine people.)",Its threat to public safety isn't high enough to impose that degree of draconian enforcement.,"Monitoring contacts and attempting to warn people? Well, yes in certain counties. As the HIV specialist for the public health department goes over before this discussion--the new case load is rising rapidly, and its hitting the poorest areas with the least resources to combat it (Specially black neighborhoods and poor rural communities). Many of these places do not have the money to combat a significant rise, and the numbers are trending up in such a way that its a very real possibility that's what will happen.","Apart from the authoritarianism, how much would it cost to enforce? Since perpatrators could presumably just move beyond state lines and come back to her state as often as they liked, would all that cost in both money and freedom actually change anything?","That's what she was finding out from the expert. The reason she asked the question like she did was not because that's her agenda, she wanted to hear the experts opinion on these things. Which is why I said, she wasn't expecting this reaction, clearly--she wanted the committee to hear every possible option while they had the expert there (But asking to shy from Quarantine).","The answer was--they don't know. They have a broad, but not deep data set. One of the biggest problems is just keeping track of the IV drug demographic. But in the end, there is no real legal way to warn people, thanks to privacy protections. The only programs they have are voluntary ones where they try to get the patients to write down their previous sexual contacts during their first treatments.","There was nothing authoritarian about a question to an expert, from another professional in the field. She wasn't advocating for anything, she wanted to listen and be informed.","Pretty basic reading comprehension would be her realizing that she was trying to head off any supposition at the pass, but then even uttering the word was probably a mistake.",No. Sorry.,I don't agree.,"The video, which is auto-played, is part of the article. It's literally part of it. Of course, if you skip part of the article, it's going to exclude content. That content just happens to be essential information, and context.","Your complaint is not that they didn't include the full truth, it's just that they didn't include the full truth in the text of the article. That's really just splitting hairs.","The only complaint I have (and most sites do it) is that they don't provide a link to the original video, but there's not a whole lot of substantial editing of her full comment.",No one watches autoplay videos. People scan the page quickly to turn them off. I believe there are some extensions that shut off autoplay completely. People absolutely HATE autoplay.,I watched the autoplay video.,For starters it didn't autoplay for me. When I did click play I had to listen to an ad.,Secondly the article is what CNN wrote. That they link to what she said is nice of them but it's absolutely fair to judge them on what they wrote. The video is a second article embedded in the first.,Your complaint is not that they didn't include the full truth,Yes it is. That is absolutely my complaint.,"I shouldnt have to click on a link, listen to an add and then listen to a dry clip in order to realise that the written article is misleading me.",Ive no idea why you would pretend otherwise but you are unambiguously wrong.,Edit: autocorrect ducked me.,"The video isn't an article, it's a video. It is a video of what she said. It's part of the article.",And use adblock. Why are you not using adblock?,"Why are you saying someone is unambiguously wrong? That's not even a good debate tactic, that's just tapping early, with rhetoric.","If the video cant be an article because its a video then it cant be part of a written article either because its not an article, its a video.",Yawn. Like I said. Unambiguously wrong.,"Even with the context, she still asked. I don't see the lie. Maybe someone can explain why the context changes anything?","But she didn't ask. The bold part is supposed to be context connecting it to the discussing in the video I linked. The HIV expert from the health department was discussing people who come in, get diagnosed, get Anti-Viral treatment and then discontinue their medication","The discussion was on that group, and why they do this.

She then asks what they are legally able to do (About stopping these people from exposing others). She specifically says she doesn't want to bring up the word quarantine, but does want to know what they can do to limit intentional exposure given privacy laws. (So she's discussing legal remedies to try and prevent this specific group from dangerously exposing others, but she is SPECIFICALLY saying she is avoiding any allusion to quarantine--she simply wants to know about their tracking program and what the state can legally do to aid it and curtail the risk this population engenders.)","At no point does she ask to quarantine people, in fact the word was said to specifically illustrate she was not asking about that.","She said she did not want to say the word but right after says : ""But I just said it"". She just admitted to saying it. Lol","Whatever she has said, taking it out of context and try to give it a more negative meaning to it is not right. This is not what journalism should be about.","Since I have not yet have the chance to verify both links myself, with this story being CNN vs. a Republican lawmaker, whose husband happens to for for the president, I am inclined to believe CNN is in the wrong here.",CNN: The Most Fake Name in News!,"And Reddit eats it up, even though she was asking haltingly from a medical viewpoint","No, the quote is accurate. The bolded text doesn't add context. She sort of points out how she's using a provocative word. I think there is a better word for it, possible. Or maybe she didn't fully think through using it. But the implication of what she said is quarantining a particular group of people.","The quote is not accurate. She specifically says she doesn't want to use the word quarantine. She is discussing contacts that a specific group of carriers exposes, and how they can legally limit that exposure. This group is compromised of people who go into remission, then think the medicine isn't doing anything for them or they are cured and allow their viral load to skyrocket again. The discussion before this question was about access to treatment and other avenues to stop this, and finally she wanted to ask for legal remedies--but she SPECIFICALLY said she didn't want to use the word quarantine, she just wanted methods for surveying contacts and reaching out to intimate partners that might be exposed to these individuals.",I'm not sure how you can say a quote is accurate when what she said was literally refuting that quote.,And then she immediately backtracks and said she is using the word.,"No, she said ""I guess I just did""--the connotation is pretty clear that she didn't want to mention it. She was just bringing it up because she didn't want her words twisted to that as she asked about legal remedies.",I don't want to say the 'quarantine' word,"See, she's very much concerned about the specter of the word itself, how much damage it can do just being uttered. She also knows of the history of the virus, and how ""legal remedies"" meant to isolate people from contacts (Which is what they were discussing), is seen as a quarantine.",but I guess I just said it,"And she just admitted she screwed up a bit by mentioning the unmentionable. So she immediately goes back to the subject, not wanting to go afield, and has the doctor explain things to her.","Have none of you been in a discussion and done something like this ""I don't want to say that, but crap I guess I just did..""--It was obvious from the context she wasn't discussing a general quarantine, and her answer showed that.",You're saying she didn't mean to say the word she obviously made the point of saying?,"For someone who supposedly knows the power of what she says in meetings like that, she obviously could have phrased it any number of ways that were better.","""Obviously, no one would think of quarantining people ...""","""Let me make it clear, we would never seek to quarantine people  but ...""","But, even then, there are far better words or phrases to use. It's obvious she intended to use the word to be proactive.","How is government surveillance much better than quarantine?

"YAVORIV, Ukraine — American troops are training Ukrainian forces on Russia's doorstep, a move seen as a major provocation by Vladimir Putin's regime.","The live-fire drills and counter-insurgency exercises involving about 300 U.S. paratroopers are a key bone of contention for the Moscow, which the West accuses of helping to arm pro-Kremlin rebels in eastern Ukraine.","The U.S. military has previously conducted exercises that involved Ukrainian soldiers, but the direct training is a first. Relations between Washington and Moscow are at their lowest ebb in decades with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warning late last year that the world was ""on the brink of a new Cold War.""","Russia has also been excluded from this weekend's G-7 summit in Schloss Elmau, Germany, due to its annexation of the Ukraine's Crimea region. U.S. President Barack Obama, upon arriving in Germany, said the summit would discuss Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine.","During the current six-month mission which began in April, the U.S. military is working with more than 700 Ukrainian soldiers in three rotations. Trainers say that their students are improving quickly.","“From what we saw at day one to where they are at right now, they’ve proven their willingness to learn,” Capt. Nick Salimbene told NBC News. “They’re getting better on a day-to-day basis.”","The training by members of the U.S. Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade is taking place about 700 miles away from the front lines in Eastern Ukraine, where fighting intensified late last week.","According to the U.N., at least 6,400 people have been killed in the conflict since April 2014. It is never far from the minds of the Ukrainians being taught by U.S. service members.","During a recent visit by NBC News to the Yavoriv training center, two young Ukrainian National Guardsmen fired RPGs and watched as a wooden tank outline at the other end of the field splintered into pieces. The soldiers cheered in unison with their comrades and their American trainers.",The heavily-armed unit had made its way through fields shooting at pop-up targets and simulating the take-over of a command post.,"“This is a scenario they could see in the conflict in the east,” 2nd Lt. Ty Boyle, one of the American trainers, told NBC News.","The American training is at the request of the Kiev government, which is trying to modernize its military.",But Moscow isn't happy about it.,"""The participation of instructors or specialists from third countries on Ukrainian territory, where the domestic Ukrainian conflict is unresolved, could destabilize the situation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a conference call when the training was launched in April.","Ukrainian soldiers undergoing the training told NBC News that they expect to soon return to the frontline and said that the American efforts to teach urban warfare, counter-insurgency operations, and anti-propaganda training would help them.","U.S. military officials insist its military support is limited to defensive efforts. They say that they deliver no weapons, only protective gear, medical kits and vehicles — and only train soldiers of the National Guard, which is limited to missions inside Ukraine's borders.",But ongoing training is also a sign toward Moscow that the United States will stand by the Western-oriented government in Kiev.,"“It demonstrates that the U.S. is there to stay,” Maxim Shepovalenko, a military analyst at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies in Moscow, said. While U.S. support to the Ukrainian military is unlikely to change the balance on the battlefield, he highlighted parallels with another conflict.","“This all is very reminiscent of the 50-year-old story with Vietnam,” Shepovalenko added. “The U.S.-Vietnam involvement started with instructors as well and then it developed into a full-scale military involvement.”",© 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL
"Western Union, the money sending giant based in the USA has been testing Ripple blockchain technology to implement it in money transfers, said its CEO.","“We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities. And we do test, we do have some tests with Ripple” said Hikmet Ersek, Western Union CEO, when he was confronted about the subject at hand. Western Union is not the first money transfer service to test blockchain related technology for its operations. Other banks and transfer services are already aiding themselves with Ripple and blockchain tech.","Traditionally, these kinds of services rely on pre-allocated FIAT money in accounts all over the world to make transfers and send money across borders, but the process still involves a lot of checks and delays. With the application of blockchain technologies, these transfers would be made instantly even across countries charging their users even lower fees. Even if it is the testing stages, it is exciting to think that secure money transfers could be made in few seconds virtually free, relying on crypto tech."

"Yes, in two ways. Firstly when you send a voltage down a wire, if the wire is say, unconnected, the pulse can reflect at the end because of the impedance mismatch and briefly create a small voltage spike. This brief spike can be up to double the signal voltage so if your signal is high to begin with it can cause a problem. Even connected cables still experience this, so If you want a good signal on long cables they need to be impedance-matched to stop voltages bouncing back and forth at junctions and disrupting any data you are sending along the cable.","Secondly the rush of current along a cable creates a magnetic field around the wire. Depending on the orientation of the wire (kinked or wound) this can create opposing magnetic fields which push against each other. If the current is very high, the cable can move slightly, though most high current cables would be too heavy to notice much movement.","If the current is very high, the cable can move slightly, though most high current cables would be too heavy to notice much movement.",I've seen a funny example of this - we were running an experiment at a particle accelerator (a fixed target muon beamline at the CERN SPS) that involved peltier coolers with a temperature controller switching them on/off (they draw a couple of amps) and a very powerful (1.6 T) superconducting magnet with a large bore (you could walk inside it - in fact one of my colleagues almost got stuck there once as he forgot that he was wearing bike shoes with cleats).,"We switched on the magnet and the experiment, and went to close off the area so that we could take beam. But then we noticed a weird sound, a ""click-swish-clack"" sound with a few second intervals. Peering down at the experiment from a ""walkbridge"" above the beamline, we saw the the whole ""anaconda"" of cables running from the rack just outside the magnet to the experimental table inside the magnet swinging from side to side every few seconds. After quickly realizing it was due to the current drawn by the peltier coolers that was being switched on and off, we tied it down with a thousand cable ties probably a bit of duct-tape, and went on to collect some very nice data :)","There's an tale where I work where an electric train had a dead short. They powered it up and the traction supply cables running between the pantograph vehicle and the motor vehicles, which normally hang down, moved 90° in opposite directions due to the magnetic fields!",So when you see cut electric cables in films flailing about it could actually happen?,"Yes, but probably for a different reason.","A cut and insulated cable only conducts at the tip, so when it touches the ground there's an arc that vaporizes any water in the ground - this creates a little jet of steam that can push the cable around.","Not saying that the current doesn't have an effect, but it's probably not the biggest contribution.",1 more reply,"The flailing is mostly for dramatic effect. When it does happen IRL, it's generally because:","The storm that broke the wires is still going on, and they're in high wind (most common)",The wires were previously under high mechanical tension and are still releasing that mechanical energy (but this won't last very long),"But, as somebody who's attended to a lot of downed powerlines, I can assure you most of the time they just sort of drop and then sit there.","I’ve seen high voltage wire continue flailing, for sure!!  Basically every time the tip hit the pavement, huge sparks would fly everywhere and the cable went flying, till it hit again. Repeat. This went on for well over an hour before the utility got it shut off.",2 more replies,"I saw this once when a cafe I was in caught fire. The whole building went up in flames fast. Ran outside, and after a few minutes I saw powerlines on the ground jumping around a bit and sparking. Maybe there was heat or drafts or something fire related helping with the movement, but I was 'damn, that's just like the movies'",Yep! Just gotta get em swinging first so they can bounce into something (zombie corpse for example) and short out.,1 more reply,2 more replies,"When messing around with coilguns and high energy capacitor banks, I've had the main power cables smack around and go flying before.","While trying to find the circuit breaker for a bunch of outlets in a large industrial building we decided to speed things up a bit and did a don't try this at... ever by making a wall plug with a dead short across the line and neutral. All the wiring ran through steel conduit so when we plugged in the short a loud 60 Hz buzz shot across the conduit until the breaker popped. Quite surprising, actually.",Ha Ha I did this too but the breaker was defective and didn't trip. I was using a protected switch plugged into the outlet so I could turn it off before melting the insulation.,1 more reply,Sounds like you could use a circuit breaker tracer. They save so much time. Plug the one piece into the outlet then switch the wand on and go to the breaker box.,They make cheap toners for breakers FYI. You plug the transmitter into an outlet on the circuit and then run the toner down the breakers.,1 more reply,"That's petty cool. I used to work on a coal mine and one time during lunch break all the guys were in the kitchen which is usually where the transformer is that everything is plugged into, Miner, shuttle cars, roof bolter, you name it, it's most likely drawing power from it. Anyways, around the corner from the kitchen there was a shuttle car that had a bad spot in the cable. the on-shift electrician was working on it. He had a tool that he called a ""thumper"" that he put between the transformer and the cable that sends a pulse down the cable to get the bad spot to do something. It looked like a snake flopping around on the floor where the bad spot was. Also, when I say bad spot on the cable, then even a pin hole would be a problem for that high of voltage.",2 things:,I love how nonchalantly you mention working at a particle accelerator.,How does anyone forget they are wearing metal bike cleats?,14 more replies,7 more replies,1 more reply,"You can actually mesure the cable length by this exact mean. By knowing how fast the electricity travel in the wire, you can then send a pulse and watch for it's reflection. Divide by two and you get the delay. Some math and you now have the wire length. (velocity / 1 sec = distance / mesuredtime).","I actually did that when I wanted to know the velocity in a coax, I mesured 241ft of coax, send a pulse at one end (signal generator), watched it come out at the other end (oscilloscope). And for the heck of it, I did the same but both at one end. Twice the delay, came very close to the same math. The error was due to the cable that deform the signal and the signal came weaker so harder to take precise mesurements. But it worked.",The signal actually travel at 85.23% the speed of light inside that coax.,"Why did it mattered for me? Because I made an antenna out of it, and it's length is dependent on the electricity speed.

They install coax in boreholes. The cables shear where the ore body has sheared so you can tell where your stope is.,2 more replies,Back when we used loops of coax to connect multiple computers (10Mbps Ethernet yay) I used a fancy cable tester to know where a faulty cable was. It told me how many centimetres away the fault was. Typically it was the connectors and not the cables.Then I could go there and wiggle it a bit and it worked until the next time someone had the audacity to move again.,"ya, the move from 2Mbps to 10Mbps was awesome. Like the jump from 1200 to 9600/14.4k baud.",7 more replies,I used similar tech back in the mid 80's on F/A-18 jets. They had microwave tubes running down the backbone of the fuselage to the back of the tail/vertical stabilizer. A once a year inspection called for checking the integrity of these. Making sure the connections from section to section were seamless. Would send a signal at one end and determine how far down the aircraft I'd have to start looking for cracks or loose connections. Pretty cool.,"Just out of curiosity, what are the microwave tubes for?","I believe he is talking about a wave guide. On aircraft they are used for satellite communication and on ships for RADAR. Basicly just a hollow tube that serves the same purpose as a wire but for very high frequency, high power applications.",2 more replies,2 more replies,1 more reply,"I used to work for a phone company, they use wire pairs for ""traditional"" telephone lines. These wires are conductors, and being wire pairs, they are separated by insulators, so they are technically capacitors. By measuring the capacitance across the wires, they have a reasonable way of gauging how long a given cable is. Of course, any equipment with capacitance that is hooked up to the line will throw off this measurement. I once had a line measure literally hundreds of kilometers, probably because of this effect. If the measurement had been correct, that line would have spanned roughly the distance from Amsterdam to Paris.",11 more replies,Thank you for the explanation!,"They also have a similar ""water hammer"" effect if disconnected while carrying very high current.  The inductance will keep the current flowing momentarily, and if there's nowhere for it to it will pile up at the end of the cable and spark.","Electrician here.  The term you're looking for is ""magnetic whip,"" if you feel like doing more digging later.",1 more reply,"If the current is very high, the cable can move slightly, though most high current cables would be too heavy to notice much movement.","Actually, with extremely high current such as that which can occur in a short circuit event on a high voltage power system, the forces exerted on the current carrying conductors and connections can be quite extreme.  HV substations, transmission lines, and even MV distribution lines need to be properly supported and braced to handle these forces.  It's a significant design consideration when building this type of infrastructure.","This is also how they test for faults in wire in pipeline that is buried. They use a ""thumper"" to apply a metric shitload of voltage until it faults through the insulation which causes high current for a very very short time, just enough for the wire to thump around in the pipe.","Thumpers typically use voltages similar in range to a power frequency test but tend to be dc.  The voltage the thumper applies isn't necessarily higher than that which the cable is actually designed for but it can be.  While you are right that the cable can move around in the pipe, the arc which occurs at the fault location is what generally creates the noise used to locate the fault rather than the cable slapping around the pipe.",1 more reply,1 more reply,I used the impendance at my job to measure cable faults etc.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-domain_reflectometry,"Well said, to add to this, the second example you give is one of the Lorentz force.

Powering large a 180KVA aircraft power converter, our 3 phase input SO cable is roughly 2.5"" thick. When we snap on power, you can see the cable twitch a couple inches. But since this particular unit's input is high on the cabinet, the cable dangles in the air to the ground. We do not see this on most units (bottom entry) since the ground tends to provide enough friction to prevent movement and the fact we usually use banded cables.",Theoretically shouldn't there be an effect much more directly analogous to the water hose jerk from the momentum of the moving electrons?  I assume it would be really slight though because of the low mass and low drift velocity of electrons even with a substantial current.,17 more replies,"Well no surprisingly. The signal will travel down the wire at a good fraction of c (the speed of light) but the electrons only move a couple of cm per hour.

I was a lab tech for a company that was testing large battery backup systems for electric vehicles and some military use (not tesla/gigafactory but similar concept). we had to run short circuit testing on the units which was done remotely using a big ass relay (that's the scientific term) and some 4/0 cables. The initial current spike would be a few hundred amps and the cables would 'jump' a solid 6""~12""","I remember when we were using a 250,000w flash bulb the top of the coil would jump a foot/2 feet in the air.

How would I do that?",3 more replies,"In low voltage DC circuits that involve any lengths of wire, you'll often see a (say 1000uF) capacitor across the power (usually at the sensitive electronics end of the wire) to try and absorb that voltage spike in an effort to protect the electronics. For much lower current data lines, a series resistor is used to diminish noise from those reflections.",Is this why when you plug something in (in the US) you typically see sparks?,"That's just the fact that the voltage is always present at the plug, and is constantly trying to flow, so as you plug something in, the electricity arcs to the best path, which is the short gap between the plug and the socket.",Is that voltage reflection the cause of key bouncing?,1 more reply,"In high voltage appliances, forces from magnetic fields become quite significant. There was a big case settled recently in which 1/100 s shorts broke down some heavy machinery.",Would this be the same effect that people take advantage of when they test a cable such as a copper phone line for faults?,"Adding to this, surge current from a demanding load can also momentarily cause a thermal expansion of the wire causing it to move slightly as well. Not uncommon to see on load coupled 3 phase motors upon start-up.",If this is true then how come That Ted talk guy said electricity moves as slow as molasses through wires?,"I haven't seen the talk but I believe he is referring to electrons. The physical particles don't move much down a wire, but their combined charge does, and that is what makes the 'signal'. It's a bit like waves on the beach - the water itself doesn't rush towards the shore, but the waves do (until the waves start to break).",1 more reply,Would this effect audio signals as well?,"It's only really a problem at very high frequencies, it won't disrupt an audio signal itself, but it might cause some dB loss. Most audio cables are probably matched though as the cabling isn't very long.",1 more reply,"If the current is very high, the cable can move slightly, though most high current cables would be too heavy to notice much movement.","It doesn't need to be that high; we have a large single cylinder static diesel engine and it's started from a pair of regular car battries, with relatively simple and loose cabling between the batteries and the starter and you can see the cables spring out into an arc when there's current flowing through them.","In power lines inside of hybrid/electric cars, electric trains, etc; the force applied on the line is something so strong that you have to account for in the design.",They can move a lot.

Is there an equivalent circut component or set of components that provide the same function analogously in the same way?","Yes! Most circuits will have small capacitors connected across the power lines. These are tuned so that they absorb any fast voltage spikes, but otherwise don't interfere with the normal operation (slower voltage changes).",1 more reply,"I just learned about this in my college physics class, and when I saw the post, I thought “yes, because it creates a magnetic field” and it made me so happy to see your answer.",What's 'impedence-matched'?,"Impedance is a hard concept to grasp because it's really a mix of many things like what material the cable is made from and the dimensions of the wire etc, but to simplify things every cable has an 'ideal signal' - the ideal voltage, current and signal frequency. You want to 'match' up your cables and connectors so they're all working to the right impedance.","If a I send a signal down a cable that is properly impedance matched then what I put in at one end is what I get out of the other end, no matter how long the cable (within reason). However, if I dont have a good impedance-matched cable then the signal will get worse as it goes through the cable because parts of the signal are sort of 'echoing' around inside.","This is not a problem for slow, analogue signals, and in fact most circuits don't need to worry but sending fast information over long cables can be problematic if they are not properly matched.

This is analogue to a water hose:,Sudden stop of water flow = high mechanical force = jumping hose.,Sudden stop of electrical flow = high electrical force (voltage) = smoke (sometimes),Is this why it's not recommended to use extension cables while they are still wound up?,"No, that's because of heating - they heat up when in use (due to the resistance in the wires), and when wound up all the heat is in one place instead of getting dumped to the environment along a long cable - the surface area is way less.

There is no average current direction and the Lorentz effect is due to the instantaneous currents having opposite directions.,"The currents go in the same direction in the sense that the positive direction is the same. The phase shift means that one wire will have a negative current while the other is positive. Both are the same direction, one is just negative.","This is pretty much just semantics. What you're thinking of is correct, the instantaneous currents are going in different directions.",4 more replies,It can also happen in DC during a transient pulse - which is very common in pulse power experiments.,Wouldn't it be 120° with three phases?,1 more reply,Are you sure that's not the cables becoming magnetized by the current and repelling? I would think that would be the more prominent effect.,9 more replies,"The other comments about electrical cables physically moving are true, but I want to share something a little more abstract.","We often make analogies between current flowing through wires being like water through pipes and the voltage being like pressure that forces the water to move. When you have water flowing then cut it of suddenly, that causes a higher pressure while energy stored in the inertia of the water is dissipated. That called water hammer, and can cause the hose to move. Video. Similarly, if you have a wire carrying current and suddenly turn it off, it will cause a voltage spike. For low-power stuff that's typically not going to be much of an issue, but with higher power things, you need to be aware of that and have a way to dissipate that energy. For instance, circuit breakers for power distribution have to have a place for the energy stored in the transmission lines to go when disconnected, called a snubber. In a hose carrying water, the mass of water in the hose and speed of flow will determine how much of a pressure spike there will be. For an electrical system the inductance of the system is like the mass of water in the hose and current is like the speed of flow.",On ships you can hear water hammers as the flow of liquid hits an elbow or bend in the pipe.

This also means that transformers buzz with a different pitch in the US compared to Europe (60Hz vs 50Hz).,"The current changing causes the buzzing.  Voltage changing in a wire won't cause physical movement, but current changing generates a magnetic field and that will cause movement.

When you put current through a bent wire, there needs to be something that pushes the electrons around the bend (they naturally want to move on a straight path). It turns out that small charges develop on the surface of the wire (we call them surface charges) which attract and repel the current around the curved path.","These surface charges will also affect the positive nuclei of the atoms in the wire, pushing in the opposite direction to the bend -- as you say, this force is analogous to the jerk effect.","For small circuits (e.g. 9V battery powering LED) surface charge densities are typically only on the order of a few hundred electrons per square meter, so the force is going to be super tiny.",For small circuits (e.g. 9V battery powering LED) surface charge densities are typically only on the order of a few hundred electrons per square meter,"Wait, the area of a tiny wire is going to be what, a few square cm?

Thank you so much! :)","In different ways sure. AC always has an almost unnoticeable 'jerk' effect because of the swinging polarity. When enough AC current travels through a conductor in say a metal conduit, it will rattle audibly because the magnetic field has increased to such a magnitude.

"Throughout his race for the White House, presidential candidate Donald Trump has made some pretty offensive comments about Blacks and other minorities in this country. So it’s unsurprising when a majority of his avid supporters share those same bigoted beliefs.","According to a recent poll by Reuters/Ipsos, Trump supporters are more likely to view African-Americans as “criminal,” “unintelligent,” “lazy”, and “violent” compared to voters who backed his Republican rivals in the primaries, Reuters reports.","The survey, conducted between March and June, polled around 16,000 Americans and featured 21 questions on attitudes about race. The results revealed that a large number of Americans from both political parties viewed Blacks in a negative light. According to Reuters, Republicans in the survey expressed racial concerns to a greater degree than Democrats, but Trump supporters held the most critical views of Blacks.","For example, over half of voters who support the real-estate tycoon described African-Americans as more “violent” than whites. The same portion viewed Blacks as more “criminal” than whites, while 40 percent described them as more lazy, the news site reports.","When it came to where they lived, 36 percent of Trump supporters said, “I prefer to live in a community with people who come from diverse cultures,” compared to 46 percent of Ted Cruz supporters and 55 percent of John Kasich supporters. Cruz and Kasich ended their presidential bids near the end of the presidential primary.","The poll also found Trump supporters to be more critical of affirmative action policies that favor minorities, viewing them as “discriminatory” toward white people.","Not all of the Republican candidate’s supporters expressed negative opinions of Blacks, however. According to Reuters, no more than 50 percent of Trump-lovers rated Blacks negatively, compared to whites, on any of the six character traits in the poll.","In addition to examining the racial attitudes of Republican voters, the survey also looked at the attitudes of Democratic voters. For example, supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also viewed Blacks more negatively compared to whites concerning specific personality traits, Reuters reports.","According to the poll, close to a third of her supporters described African-Americans as more “violent” and “criminal” than whites, while one-quarter viewed Blacks as more “lazy” than whites. Seventy percent said they would prefer to live in a community that was diverse.","When compared to the responses given by Trump supporters, Clinton advocates gave answers that were quite similar. For example, the poll reports that 32 percent of Trump supporters placed whites closer to the top tier of “intelligence” than they did African-Americans;  22 percent of Clinton supporters did the same.","In another instance, 44 percent of Trump-lovers described whites as more “well mannered” than Blacks, compared to 30 percent of Clinton supporters.","Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser for Trump, disagrees with the poll and the negative light it shines on the GOP presidential candidate and his supporters.","“Mr. Trump is an egalitarian who believes in supporting and protecting all people equally,” Miller said. “This is a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose policies have been a disaster for African-American and Hispanic citizens.”","Earlier this month, a similar study conducted by political scientist Philip Klinker found that racial anxiety toward Blacks, immigrants, and Muslims are the driving force behind support for Trump, Atlanta Black Star reports."

In most, he’s alone, flashing a big smile, often taking a photo of his reflection in a bathroom mirror. In others, he is joined by friends. But nowhere is a gun seen or referenced, except in a cartoon image he posted in March of a boy holding a gun in each hand and wearing a Superman shirt.","Jones, 34, said his son went by the nickname “Tez.” He had just finished his freshman year at Ritenour High School.","“He loved hockey and rock ’n’ roll,” Jones said.","Diane Jones, the boy’s paternal grandmother, said her grandson was “real smart,” had been baptized and had a renewed focus on attending church, and enjoyed playing golf.",Dennis Jones said the death of his son makes him firmly believe two pieces of advice.,"“Parents should spend more time with their kids,” he said.","“And if they have guns in the house, put a lock on the gun. Police give them out for free.”","The police investigation continues. Branham said it is possible, though unlikely, that the gun owner could face charges, on a count such as endangering the welfare of a child.","The funeral will be June 14 at House of Deliverance Church, at 9355 St. Charles Rock Road.

"As Canadian police forces complete pilot projects assessing whether officers will wear video cameras on their uniforms, experts in both civil rights and policing say they see value in the practice but urge proceeding with caution. ","""The 'how' is extremely important,"" Laura Berger, acting director of the public safety program at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told CBC News. ""This is an area where the devil is absolutely in the details."" ","The Toronto Police Service wrapped up the 10-month test phase of a pilot project that equipped about 100 officers with body-worn cameras on March 31. The evaluation process is expected to be completed by June 30, police spokesman Mark Pugash said.","The idea of using body-worn video cameras gained momentum in the U.S. and Canada over the last few years amid concerns from both the public and the police about use of force and misconduct allegations. In 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama pledged millions of dollars for 50,000 body cameras to be distributed to police departments across the country. ","In Canada, Calgary is the city closest to outfitting all of its front-line uniformed police officers with the cameras — something the police force has announced it will do by 2017.  ","""This is the future,"" Kevin Brookwell, spokesman for the Calgary Police Service, told CBC News. ""Everybody from, you know, elementary school right up to adults have smartphones or cameras. How is it that a policing agency in the … 21st century has no capability of recording what we're doing?"" ",,,,,"The Edmonton Police Service planned to move forward on a smaller scale by distributing 60 cameras to members of its traffic services branch, but halted the program due to lack of funding, said Peter Clissold, the police service's security director and the lead for its body-worn camera pilot project.  ","Clissold said in addition to funding, body-worn cameras raise a number of concerns that need to be addressed, including privacy, ""because it's such new technology"" that Canadian legislation doesn't specifically cover it.","""There's going to be new ground,"" he said. ""The main findings [of the pilot project] were that there actually remained a lot of unanswered questions,"" ",,,,,"Clissold said the pilot project in Edmonton found ""no effect on the use of force,"" contrary to observations by Brookwell in Calgary, as well as findings cited by some police forces in the U.S. ",,,,,,,,,"Berger, of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, said it's important to test assumptions in this emerging area of technology and policing. ","""I think there is an assumption that if people are being filmed, they will not unnecessarily use violence, that they'll be more conscious and more thoughtful about the ways that they react because they know that they're on camera,"" she said. ","""We need to be cautious of the idea that video never lies and that video evidence will provide a panacea to concerns about police use of force and accountability.""","However, the CCLA does believe police body cameras ""can be an important tool for accountability and transparency,"" Berger said, as long as ""the accountability benefits outweigh any privacy risks"" for the public.","One of the key questions, she said, is determining when the cameras should be on or off, and who makes that decision.","""The value of a body camera as an accountability tool is eroded if the individual officer has control and discretion over when to turn it on,"" she said. ""If officers can pick and choose which interactions they want to record ... we might expect that negative interactions are not going to be recorded, and so we're not going to have that evidence that could be useful in cases of police violence or in cases where complaints are lodged.""","Still, Berger believes it's possible for police services to ""strike the appropriate balance"" with clear policies stipulating what must be recorded, including arrests, and disciplinary consequences for officers who don't have a ""reasonable explanation for why there wasn't footage of [an] interaction.""","Brookwell agrees, saying the Calgary police worked extensively on a comprehensive policy and will continue to revise it as new questions or issues arise.",He said situations in which officers can or should turn off their cameras include:,"Police officers themselves have many unanswered questions when it comes to wearing cameras, said Bruce Chapman, president of the Police Association of Ontario. ","""We're not opposed to it,"" Chapman said. ""We see some value to it to protect our officers and … to get a full version of an event or an action where the police are engaged with members of the public.""","However, ""there's so many variables that cause us some concern that haven't been fully explored,"" he said, including whether cameras can be turned on in people's houses or in police cars when two officers are alone having a conversation.  ","""I just think we need to tread slowly and carefully … and have all those answers before we go full speed ahead,"" Chapman said.",Brookwell said that's what Calgary police are doing. ,"""We want to do it right.
